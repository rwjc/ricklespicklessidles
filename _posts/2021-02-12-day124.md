You know what I love? I’m gonna tell you what I love - in a song.

Rest day in Te Anau. No need to hurry anymore. Also I want to finish TA with this group of cool people. We just realised it’s less than 2 weeks (probably less) before it’s all done! Getting emotional already. A bit premature still though. 

Breakfast at The Sandfly.

I swung by the community centre. It has badminton courts! Ben said he wanted to challenge me. I’m no [Lin Dan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Dan) (obviously✖️♾) but I reckon I could take him on. It’s been awhile since I played. The only problem is we don’t have any racquets or shuttles. 

I bumped into Alex on his way to the Kepler Track by the lake. He looked excited.

At the back of a hospice shop were some old timey badminton racquets. These could be the last resort. 

This is Catherine’s resupply. Everyone is coming on the Radix train. I’ve only had 2 on the Whanganui journey and I kept the containers  to cook in. People think I’m super loaded and eating 2 Radix everyday. In reality it’s all a facade.

We were planning to do a yoga class in the community centre at 12am. But we were cutting it really close and we didn’t want to arrive at the start of the class huffing and puffing. So we went back to the hostel and just did our own versions of yoga on the lawn. Catherine had once been a yoga instructor. She looked like she knew what she was doing. 

It turned out Bat has some at the YHA so we borrowed them. Then we played on the lawn with a volleyball net. Close enough.

I played Ben. It was fun. Although the sun and the occasional breeze caused problems. Then Ben and Charlotte had a go.

Charlotte was knocked out and tried to cover herself with someone’s sleeping bag. But it was apparently too smelly and she threw it off straight away.

Ciara had some burnt lips and was actively trying to avoid exposing it to the sun for the whole day. Buffs are really useful.

I went to Miles Better Pies and had a pie, hot chips, and a thick shake.

In the afternoon I finally started on something that I’ve been putting off for a long time - repairing my pack. There are some unraveling seams and a big ripped hole on the mesh at the back and some cuts around the side. The end result is pretty shocking. I hope they hold up.

The hole was patched up with a TA patch! I’ve been carrying it this whole way with the intention of putting it on the pack somehow. Now I’ve used it to patch a hole. I had to buy some cheap fabric from the hospice shop (it’s just a pair of undies actually) to sew the patch to.

Went out to the Bao Now food truck again. It’s really good.

It’s not real.

I went to Subway to get lunch for tomorrow. This time I got a footlong.

Back at the YHA Debbie came in. We were last with her at the cute A Frame Hut. I sold her a Local Dehy meal (with a discount) that I don’t need anymore. Later she gave me a gluten free chocolate Cornetto. It’s actually really good!

We will all try and get a shuttle early tomorrow morning to the trailhead.
