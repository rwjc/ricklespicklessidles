I walked down the quiet streets of Wanaka in the morning, with my earphones in. Suddenly Catherine ran past and stopped just beside me. She was calling out from behind but I couldn’t hear her. Not sure why she ran but it gave me a fright. Charlotte casually walked on by.

We had breakfast at Kai Whakapai again and it was great. A friendly dog kept doing the rounds beneath every table with people. We must have been dropping crumbs all over.

Kate and I are shoe buddies! She apparently had issues with this particular model but she was able to mould it and shape it with a knife to make it more comfortable for her feet. I haven’t had to do that just yet.

Resupply. Yay time to make my pack rickdickulously heavy again.

I had lunch at Fedeli which was in a little alleyway. It’s neat.

We walked around some more.

For dinner I cooked steak and vegetables. There were a lot of vegetables.

It turned out Tahlia was in town which was a pleasant surprise. Finally reunited (briefly) after Wellington. I met her partner Jin (not sure about the spelling I should’ve asked sorry about that). We caught up over some ice cream. She is currently off trail doing, of all things, more hiking. Tahlia has just done the Gillespie Circuit.
