I walked down the quiet streets of Wanaka in the morning, with my earphones in. Suddenly Catherine ran past and stopped just beside me. She was calling out from behind but I couldn’t hear her. Not sure why she ran but it gave me a fright. Charlotte casually walked on by.

We had breakfast at Kai Whakapai again and it was great. A friendly dog kept doing the rounds beneath every table with people. We must have been dropping crumbs all over.

Kate and I are shoe buddies! She apparently had issues with this particular model but she was able to mould it and shape it with a knife to make it more comfortable for her feet. I haven’t had to do that just yet.

Resupply. Yay time to make my pack rickdickulously heavy again.

I had lunch at Fedeli which was in a little alleyway. It’s neat.

We walked around some more.

For dinner I cooked steak and vegetables. There were a lot of vegetables.

While cooking I met a group of international travellers from Auckland (they lived there). Chris 🇫🇷, Gabbie 🇵🇪, Anne 🇩🇪, Alexandra 🇮🇹. They all met through this meetup kind of group that connects people wanting to learn and practice each other’s languages. They are planning to hike Roys Peak tomorrow. 

It turned out Tahlia was in town which was a pleasant surprise. Finally reunited (briefly) after Wellington. I met her partner Jin (not sure about the spelling I should’ve asked sorry about that). We caught up over some ice cream. Tahlia is currently off trail doing, of all things, more hiking. She has just done the Gillespie Circuit.
