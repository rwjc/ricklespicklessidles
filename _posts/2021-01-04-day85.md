Zero day. But travelled to various towns - Marahau, Kaiteriteri, Mapua, and Nelson. 

Toon also enjoys overlooking the valley.

Trevor said ‚Äúin case of global warming‚Äù.

He has a friend come to visit! ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù

Trevor gave me the keys to his ute so I could drive myself to town to do whatever it is I needed to do. GET REAL.

After a massive 14 day resupply (7 for the next stretch and another 7 for A box to Boyle Village) I went to Falafal Gourmet and ordered a ‚Äúhummus platter for one‚Äù. Paulie recommended it to me when I met him at St Arnaud.

I then went to a local post office to get 2 boxes. One to send stuff I don‚Äôt want to carry anymore home, and another one for Boyle. 

After lunch back at the house we drove to see Split Apple Rock. We went by Kaiteriteri which was choca full of people.  It was super sunny too. 

A bit later we reached a walkway with access to the beach where you can see the rock.

We swam to it and it was longer and harder than I expected. I need to swim more.

On the way back Brian called me. He‚Äôs in Nelson and want to catch up. We decided to go to Golden Bear at Mapua. It‚Äôs a wharf with lots of restaurants and some shops. There was live music and you could go for a swim if you wish. It reminded me of the viaduct in Auckland (except the swimming part).

Brian and Kelly came and they look really relaxed. Brian also wanted the lowdown of the Richmond Ranges so I gave it to him. He even brought paper maps for me to mark and make notes on. Very prepared. 

Once again I had pork ribs.

Unfortunately I had a food coma and I forgot to ask for a group photo.
