description: we climbed over the gigantic supple hill and went down sharply in its jagged end with some nice views. A highlight definitely. Reached Lake Hāwea.

Morning morning morning! Today we conquer Breast Hill.

The track to the top is graded 4WD and pretty easy.

The views at the top are really good. You can see the lake, the town, Wanaka, Mt Aspiring, and lots of mountain ranges in every direction.

We waited briefly for Charlotte so we could take more photos. Apparently Jo and Caleb took the shorter bad weather route off the hill which bypasses the peak so they could get to Subway more quickly.

And because of its name, Ciara had an urge to do this (just in case you were wondering I have their consent):

I did not partake. 

Going SOBO the track to the top is nice and gentle. But going down is quite different. It goes over a jaggedy ridge with some steep descents and scrambly parts. It’s quite fun.

While having lunch I took out my bag of nuts. The bottom of it broke and my nuts dropped to the ground. I picked them up one by one. It took a long time.

After the ridge line the track became a long series of switchbacks to the bottom.

After a short road walk we reached a picnic area which was beside the lake. Charlotte and I had a swim. The water was lovely.

We took the Gladstone track which meanders around the lake all the way into town. 

I got to a store and these were the first things I bought (and ate):

The action and sound when you open a soda can is just so satisfying.

Dinner time. I ate too much.
