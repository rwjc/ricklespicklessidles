Lots of rain overnight. There were even wekas fighting outside the tent. Sleep was good though. But Genny was grumpy in the morning. She didn‚Äôt sleep well.

The Dutch couple (Marjan and Joren) were upbeat as always. After breakfast we took a photo. Alex and Abbie has a sign they use to write and draw on for a photo journal describing each day they are on the TA. Today was day 3. Aww they grow up so fast ü•≥

I‚Äôm going to put up photos of sounds and coves that looks pretty much like the ones I‚Äôve posted in the past two days. üêªwith me.

At the junction towards Lochmara Lodge I met a family from Palmy who were doing the Queen Charlotte luxuriously - Claire, Lance and their sons Tim and James. They stay at lodges and slack pack along the way. The water taxis can take your pack each day to your next accommodation. What a nice idea.

James (the one with the thumb) is studying mechatronics and will get us to Mars (or another planet, not sure yet). Tim was really interested about the TA. He asked me many questions. He has completed studies in Law and is about to finish a commerce degree. He seems unimpressed in the photo but he was quite jovial in general. 

After lunch we heard many thunderclaps. Some of them were close and loud. We picked up the pace and by the time we got to the end the rain was pouring down. All the hikers waiting for a water taxi were huddled in a small shelter. Marjan and Joren were here too. They seemed to have been there for a long time. They must have hoofed it today.

Double thumbs up from dad. Mom hasn‚Äôt got the memo. (They were really friendly).

I found out that they live really close to the trail in Palmy. I did my part nudging Claire to look into becoming a [trail angel](https://facebook.com/groups/trailangels/). Next season maybe? ü§û

Anakiwa on a less-than-stellar day.

I said goodbye to everyone at the shelter and went to the local ‚ÄúYHA‚Äù (according to Guthook). It‚Äôs not a YHA and it was also completely booked out. Not surprising since it‚Äôs Boxing Day. The man suggested Smiths Farm 4km down the road. His son turned out was going that way and he kindly gave me a ride. 

At Smiths Farm I met Barbara who is very accomodating to TA hikers. I got a cabin and she heated up a muffin and gave me some chocolate üç´!

(Chocolate no longer pictured)

Genny has hitched back to Picton. I‚Äôm going to take an early bus there in the morning so I could pick up my resupply which was stored in a locker at Atlantis Backpackers. Then who knows what will happen. 

Tomorrow: hopefully Pelorus Bridge and Beyond.
