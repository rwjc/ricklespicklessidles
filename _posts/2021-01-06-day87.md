3.08km ~ side trip to Angelus Peak summit

Trevor took me to St Angelus in the morning. First I checked the weather at the DOC office. It’s good today but bad tomorrow. Oh well. Trevor then showed me all the eels under the jetty by Lake Rotoiti.

We got to the trailhead at Mt Robert. Trevor walked with me for a bit. It’s all up hill though.

There were few bits of forest. It was cloudy. I thought it was going to be like this for the rest of the day. Luckily that didn’t happen.

The “Relax” shelter. It’s very basic. I had an OSM bar inside.

Some of the scenery reminded me of Richmond ranges. Some of the rocky parts are very similar. But they are much shorter than the Rintouls.

Not long I reached Lake Angelus and Angelus Hut. About 4 hours from car park to hut.

The hut is very nice. It has a great view too.

I went inside to have lunch. There were two wardens and a few people staying there tonight. I was going to push on towards Sunset Saddle and a warden gave me some suggestions on where I could camp. It’s her seventh day on duty and will be going back via the ridge tomorrow. 

Hinapouri Tarn.

Sunset saddle is just left of the middle ridge and there is a small tarn just under it that feeds the larger one below. There are a few small waterfalls.

![IMG_2258](/assets/images/20210106/img_2258.jpg)

There was a couple who I thought were clogging to camp here too. But I guess they went to a different tarn instead.

A trail runner came by for a chat. He is staying at the hut but decided to go and summit the Angelus Peak (2075m) nearby. I had time and I wanted to do that too. Tomorrow’s weather isn’t good so I probably won’t get any views at the saddle. Since the sky has pretty much cleared up the views will be great. I was promised. 

It took longer than I expected. Even though I slackpacked it’s still slow going. There are some steep scree slopes and lots of rock hopping. 

Eventually I got there. It did not disappoint. 

Lake Angelus from the peak.

Lake Rotoroa.

I met two other trail runners at the top. They had climbed after me. 

We took each others photos (for each other). The big mountain in the background is Mt Hopeless.

Glad to be back at camp.

Getting fancy with the cold soaking (breakfast). Trying out freeze dried raspberries and blueberry slices. 

Tomorrow: Hopeless Hut and more if the weather isn’t too terrible.
