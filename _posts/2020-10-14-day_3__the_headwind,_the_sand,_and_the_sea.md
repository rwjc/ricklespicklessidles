Mauanganui Bluff camp to Hukatere lodge.

30.98km ~ 7:29

It‚Äôs not often that I‚Äôm woken up by the neighing and galloping of horses. About 4 or 5 went right around my tent and I jolted awake thinking I was being sneak attacked!

Theo left the camp just as I was about to pack up the tent and make breakfast. He soaks chia seeds and Raro so he could eat on the go.

A police officer drove in shortly after to apprehend Barbara - they will take her to Kaitaia hospital to take a look at her wrist. We had a cup of tea with the police. Very nice fellow.

Then I went on my way to tackle the beach walk for the whole day. It‚Äôs going to be tough.

The game is to find the ideal quality of sand to walk on. Soft sand is hard (to move), too close to the water is too close to danger. Somewhere in the middle is a nice spot that is firm enough to grip your shoes and is not too spongy. It changes all the time as you move down the beach. Not the most fun.

Found a nice log (with an unopened steinlager ‚Äî trail magic?) to have lunch.

Came across a couple - one fishing and  another looking for ambergris. She told me all about it. It‚Äôs whale vomit (!!) and worths *a lot*. She said last year she found one that was the size of a golf ball and it was sold for more than 1000 dollars üò≥. They have been coming to fish on 90 Mile Beach for 19 years. They are from Waipu. Amazing chat. She even gave me some salty snacks for the road.

Then out of nowhere a plane appears in the horizon, flying very low. It flew next to me not too far away and the pilot had a good look at me. I waved and didn‚Äôt quite get my camera out soon enough. The pilot probably didn‚Äôt like that I didn‚Äôt get a good shot of his performance since Some time later he flew back from behind just as low and close. This time I got him good. The noise was pretty loud.

Oh and there are more wild horses!

Then finally I arrived at Hukatere lodge. It is a magical place. Hot showers, free oranges, tea and coffee, gas coolers, oh my!

Theo waved me in to the reception which is a nice warm room with all the goodies. There I met Susan who is a veteran long distance adventurer (PCT, AT, Tour Te Araroa - where you bike the length of NZ, and the very first class of TA hiker to do the South Island after it was officially opened, and way more). I could listen to her about her all day. I also found out she used to be a tax lawyer and is an avid Linux user to this day!

Susan did something incredibly smart. The whole day going SOBO (southbound) we had a massive headwind (southwesterly). Susan looked at the weather forecast beforehand and saw that it was the predominant wind and decided to flip it so for the beginning sections she would walk from Ahipara northward to Cape Reinga and get the nice tailwind. I didn‚Äôt even think of that!! 

Then the owner of this here establishment Gabriella came back from a meeting (about Northland tourism it turns out), with Kepr (shortened from ‚Äúkeep her‚Äù üòÑ). Introducing Kepr and her elephant friend:

Gabriella is super lovely. She has been running the lodge for 21 years and the whole place is completely off grid. It‚Äôs got solar power and bore water with gas.

All four of us had a cult of tea and chatted past hiker midnight and it was a blast.
