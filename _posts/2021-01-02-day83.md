Sam and Louise were the first to leave. They packed up the tent super early and ran off. Jack as usual woke up before 5:30 and caused a ruckus around the hut like we knew he would. He has become our daily alarm. Then Bat and Torie left. The last three of us I managed to get a preflight photo.

The reason for our speedy departure is due to the forecast which said lots of rain were coming.

There were some averagely decent views. A few small hills to climb. These were part of a mountain bike trail which was “expert” level. On one side (the side we are climbing up) are often quite steep and has lots of roots. I don’t think it’s possible for bikers to bike up this side. They must come from the other end and go down this side.

After the bushy bits the track joins a 4WD track which goes through some private properties.

Not long before we came to the end. The Richmond Ranges section is finally over.

Genny was going to get picked up by her boyfriend and will have a break to do some diving in Blenheim. She will be celebrating her birthday soon 🥳. Here we parted our ways. I hope we meet again further south. Final selfie. Emotions.

I waited for Grayson at the gate. There were lots of mountain bikers going into the mountain. I chatted with some of them. They are badasses.

Grayson arranged to stay with a trail angel not far from the trailhead. I asked to tag along but she wasn’t able to reach them. So we decided to go to St. Arnaud first to have some proper food.

We started walking SH63. It’s not that pleasant. There were lots of traffic. We tried hitching but without success. Then the rain came and Grayson asked me if it’s going to be harder to hitch. I replied “yes”. So we started walking again. Thanks to the finicky weather the rain stopped almost as soon as it started. We walked to a junction where it’ll be easier for cars to stop. It took some more time, even with one car did a fake pull over by slowing down and when we started running towards them they drove off again. So rude. Eventually two South Africans stopped and gave us a hitch. We were so happy. The driver said he was biking around somewhere and his tire had a puncture. A farmer gave him a ride back to his farm, gave him a place to stay the night, then drove him back home the next day. He thought he’d follow suit by giving hitchhikers rides too. Such legends. 

We got to the St. Arnaud Alpine Lodge and had lunch. Pizzas, fries, coffee. It’s been 7 days I had proper food.

In the afternoon I was trying to wash and dry my clothes. The whole place only has 2 washing machines and 2 dryers. There was a queue. It didn’t help when people just leave their washing in the machine and don’t pick them up. 

While hanging around I met a few other TA hikers. Robin 🇳🇿 a section hiker, Paulie 🇮🇪 a thru-hiker, and Jane 🇳🇿 who is doing the South Island only with her husband Cameron who I’ve not met. 

I went to the general store over the road and got a pie and a juice. I’ve been warned about this place. It has just about everything a hiker would need to resupply, but nothing is labelled with the price. And oh boy they are expensive. It feels like the clerk just picks a number in his head when you bring something to him. Anyway the pie was tasty, which is what’s important. 

At 5 I went down to the restaurant where TA hikers were starting to congregate. We started with 4 but more and more came throughout the evening. I met Kate 🇦🇺 and Ed 🇦🇺 who were based in Auckland. I had seen their names many times in the hut intention books. It’s good to finally put faces to their names. Eventually there were 11 of us. The manager said the record for that table was 12 TA hikers. If Louise had joined us... we still wouldn’t have broken the record. 

I had lamb shank and some veges. The meat was delicious.

Bat turned out works at the YHA in Te Anau. I most go stay there when I drop by.
