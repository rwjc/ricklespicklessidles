Good morning Riverton! (Lots of unnecessary photos later; can‚Äôt believe I had a pie for breakfast)

As our group was leaving the other was coming to the cafe. We had a stand-off mingle.

We left the others behind and set off towards Invercargill - where dreams come true (or something like that).

Today is two thirds beach walking. 90 Mile Beach flashbacks. This time a lot easier though. I walked with Molly (Christchurch) for a bit. She‚Äôs been following me in the hut books. It‚Äôs not too hard since there aren‚Äôt that many Asian names there. I‚Äôve only met two other Asians doing the TA so far (Steve üá®üá≥ and Aiden üá≤üáæ).

About 10km in a car honked us from behind. Catherine got a hell of a fright. It was Keith! We knew he was going to meet us in town but he found us on the beach. We put most of our non-essentials in his car and our packs were super light. Well, except Turbo Ben, who has the rare power where the heavier his pack is the faster he went.

There were hugs being had when I was talking a selfie with my Snickers bar (I know, roll eyes). So I joined in. They didn‚Äôt mind.

I felt really good on the beach. The others had lunch but I didn‚Äôt want to break my flow and powered on. I was going really fast (partly due to my featherlight pack).

I finished the beach walk and caught up with Raul and had lunch with him on a grassy clearing by the road. I finished eating and pushed on. But then I came across a cafe and had another coffee and a slice. Ben, Catherine, and Raul all popped in for a chat. Catherine wanted to walk together for the rest of the few kms to Invercargill. That‚Äôs what we did.

We went to a Mexican place, it was full. Then we went to a Thai place and found Debbie there with her friends. It was full too. So we ended up finding our own food. Some of us had pizza. We found the French guy with full dreads whom we met in McKellar Hut on the Greenstone track at the pizza place. He and his friends will be going to do the northern circuit in a few days. I want to do that too.
