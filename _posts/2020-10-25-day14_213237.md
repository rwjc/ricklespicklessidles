Zero day in Whananaki

The morning was spent making breakfast and gazing at that view.

Then John took us out for some fishing and to check the crayfish cage. We didn’t get any crayfish, and despite some small bites we didn’t get any fish either. Oh well can’t be lucky _all_ the time.

Then lunch was smoked kingfish sandwich. That is Poppy (Freya yes I think they should meet). I have a feeling I will post a lot of photos of Poppy.

Lots of lounging about in the great weather, and some live music, it’s time for more food.

John and others had went out to dive and brought back something scrumptious.

I ate until I could do so no more. People who know me will agree that it is no different to any other day.

Yep it’s customary here to serve fries bowl face down.

Wound down with a hot shower and marshmallows right after. Ah the life.

John and Robyn are amazing hosts and took great care of me completely. I would probably stay even longer but I should really get back on the trail. Okay, tomorrow!
