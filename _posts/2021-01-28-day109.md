The GPS record looks strange because I overhitched to Omarama from Twizel. So I had to hitch back to the junction to Lake Ohau, then a final hitch to the trailhead. 

Ciara and I had planned to bike to Lake Ohau. This required us to get to the bike rental depot before 8:30am. Normally that would be not a problem. But we were hung over. So that did not happen. 

Waddle waddle waddle.

Keith has officially finished the TA once he arrived at Twizel. We split the group to make it easier to get a hitch.

It didn‚Äôt take us too long. A group of friends in 3 separate cars stopped for us. Keith, Ciara, and I each went into a different car. My one‚Äôs driver was Zac üá∫üá∏ from Minnesota. Turns out he is good mates with Liam, the crazy Canadian I met in Kerikeri who started the TA in November last year. He shouldn‚Äôt be far behind me. 

Because I was careless I didn‚Äôt see the sign to lake Ohau so I missed the junction. I ended up in Omarama. It took slightly longer but I got a hitch back to the junction by a dad and daughter duo in a campervan. They were finishing their holiday and were going home to Christchurch. 

The junction. It‚Äôs 17km from everywhere.

There were bird nests in every letter of the word Ohau.

I started walking from the junction but I were soon picked up by an older couple John and Heather üá≥üáø. They were there to checkout the damage done by the big fire at Ohau last year. It turned out they are good friends with a couple whose daughter, Jessica E., worked closely with me in the last few years. Small world!

I got to the trailhead. Ciara, Catherine, Charlotte were having lunch. Glad I caught them in time. 

After some fun and games in town we were again back on trail. There were lots of burnt trees, but it was good being in the bush again.

A climb and some sidlings later we got to the hut. It‚Äôs unnamed on the map but the intentions book called it East Ahuriri Hut.

The hut was rustic but it has a nice new door and interestingly tiled floors. There were even sections of carpet you could put your air mattress on. its quite cozy.
