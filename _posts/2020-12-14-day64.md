Makahika to Te Matawai Hut

22.15km ~ 8:27

- Gable End Ridge Track
- Dora Track

Blue bird day. At least in the morning. 

We had really bad condensation at the Makahika OPC campsite. Just one of those things. All three of us helped out throwing out the compost toilet bag which was inside a bucket. The bag caught on the handle as it fell out. It wasn‚Äôt pretty. 

After a big breakfast (already trying to keep the pack weight down), we got on the road.

The slip sign is an omen about what we will have to face later on. We did hear that there‚Äôs a major slip on the track to the Gable End Ridge. There‚Äôs a possible alternate track that we could take that will bypass this slip should it be too risky but it is quite a bit longer. We planned to reach the slip and see how bad it is and decide then.

We are a party of three persons only ü§®

Always eager to see if there‚Äôs cell service and catch up on the world if there happen to be some.

Standard New Zealand tramping.

We reached the slip, just before the swing bridge prior to the steep ascent. It‚Äôs bad but looks doable. We took turns and went over slowly by grabbing onto what ever vegetation we could get our hands on. I wasn‚Äôt used to this and I was quite scared. We made it safely with no dramas.

Taking the Gable End Track. The climb started immediately and it is very steep at the beginning. It is also very very muddy and slow going. We did not expect it to be so slow.

Twin Peaks.

We got above the tree line, but that was only the first challenge (second if you include the slip). We could see the peaks and ridges of the northern Tararua Ranges. 

![IMG_0490](/assets/images/20201214/img_0490.jpg)

Hot and hard going.

It took a long time, but we eventually got on top of _Richards Knob_. It was hard work.

We took a break but the sign said it was still 2 hours to the hut! For 3km! (It turned out we did it in a shorter time, probably because we were so determined to get there).

Happy to get some views.

On the way to the hut we had great views of the ridge line on the helipad.

There were lots of people here. A bunch of girls doing the Duke of Edinburg and some other trampers of all ages. 

We were the only TA hikers until another came in. It was Charlotte! I hadn‚Äôt seen here since Waipu. She had a friend with her - Julia, who has done the TA over the last two years. They are really fun to chat with. We had the table alto ourselves and ate lunch and basically talked about everything to do with hiking.

At sunset I went back to the Helipad to take some photos of the mountain glow.

It was a tough day. The distance is not useful to gauge the speed. Or at least it is useful only as a guideline for future hikes in the Tararuas. 

Tomorrow: Nichols Hut
