Breakfast.

The Birchwood hut was full of mosquitoes. I didn‚Äôt get a good night sleep. Somehow I even got bitten on my knee. I had long johns on. 

This is how Ciara packs up her tent, full of joy.

There was a pony nearby too.

Goodbye Birchwood hut.

The boys hard at work. 

![IMG_4979](/assets/images/20210216/img_4979.jpg)

Gravel road.

![IMG_4989](/assets/images/20210216/img_4989.jpg)

The only steep climb today. It‚Äôs not very long though. 

![IMG_4992](/assets/images/20210216/img_4992.jpg)

Twinlaw. 

![IMG_5002](/assets/images/20210216/img_5002.jpg)

![IMG_5005](/assets/images/20210216/img_5005.jpg)

Forestry road. 

![IMG_5011](/assets/images/20210216/img_5011.jpg)

Then it got narrower and some mud underfoot. 

![IMG_5012](/assets/images/20210216/img_5012.jpg)

Some nice bush and creepy pines. 

![IMG_5014](/assets/images/20210216/img_5014.jpg)

![IMG_5016](/assets/images/20210216/img_5016.jpg)

![IMG_5033](/assets/images/20210216/img_5033.jpg)

![IMG_5035](/assets/images/20210216/img_5035.jpg)

Scotts Gap is everywhere. 

![IMG_5040](/assets/images/20210216/img_5040.jpg)

I met a friendly doggo. 

![IMG_5042](/assets/images/20210216/img_5042.jpg)

![IMG_5044](/assets/images/20210216/img_5044.jpg)

Then Catherine came up and stole him from me. 

![IMG_5051](/assets/images/20210216/img_5051.jpg)

![IMG_5054](/assets/images/20210216/img_5054.jpg)

![IMG_5055](/assets/images/20210216/img_5055.jpg)

For lunch I had 4 slices of pizza I saved from last night. It‚Äôs so good. My favourite trail tip - get takeaway whenever you can. 

![IMG_5058](/assets/images/20210216/img_5058.jpg)

Island Bush is a forestry track and it‚Äôs tranquil. 

![IMG_5060](/assets/images/20210216/img_5060.jpg)

![IMG_5061](/assets/images/20210216/img_5061.jpg)

![IMG_5063](/assets/images/20210216/img_5063.jpg)

![IMG_5073](/assets/images/20210216/img_5073.jpg)

Mushroom. 

![IMG_5070](/assets/images/20210216/img_5070.jpg)

Some road walking to finish the day. 

![IMG_5078](/assets/images/20210216/img_5078.jpg)

Merriview Hut. It‚Äôs private and nice. It runs on honesty and has some goods to sell as well. 

![IMG_5081](/assets/images/20210216/img_5081.jpg)

![IMG_5090](/assets/images/20210216/img_5090.jpg)

![IMG_5091](/assets/images/20210216/img_5091.jpg)

![IMG_5092](/assets/images/20210216/img_5092.jpg)

We met a NOBO - Evan from New Jersy üá∫üá∏. It was his birthday yesterday and he got some biscuits and jetplanes to share. Ciara played her recorder and we sang happy birthday for him. ü•≥. Catherine also made us some tea. 

![IMG_5086](/assets/images/20210216/img_5086.jpg)

![IMG_5088](/assets/images/20210216/img_5088.jpg)

Tender moment. 

![IMG_5097](/assets/images/20210216/img_5097.jpg)

Alex likes to get involved in the tent drying process personally. 

![IMG_5099](/assets/images/20210216/img_5099.jpg)

Look at all the mess you‚Äôve made!

![IMG_5100](/assets/images/20210216/img_5100.jpg)

Deer watching cult. 

![IMG_5103](/assets/images/20210216/img_5103.jpg)

Today is a 3-Radix day. (Just kidding, only one of them is a real Radix). 

![IMG_5104](/assets/images/20210216/img_5104.jpg)

Later a NOBO came in. His name is Tiger üá´üá∑. What a cool name.

Also, we played UNO (it was in the hut). It was a bad idea.
