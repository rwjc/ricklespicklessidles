Mangawhai to Pakiri

24.3km ~ 5:36

Short day. Started later than usual and I made it even later (deliberately) by having breakfast at a bakery in Mangawhai town. I was dawdling to try and get to the streams on the beach later at lower tides.

I walked some roads passed rivers and farms.

Then a sign that would normally be mundane excited me to no end.

Some forestry tracks led me to the beaches that will take me all the way to Pakiri.

Some nice weather later I caught up to Susan who was staying a few km further SOBO from me last night. Still going strong as usual.

The hills have eyes.

A guy was flying kites super high. I didn‚Äôt even realise what he was doing until I got close to him. The kites are basically specks in the photo (if you can see them at all).

Pakiri Beach holiday park and the nice $30 cabins for TA walkers with queen size bed üòç.

Paul later showed up as well. So we have a nice chat about the following sections which are kind of tricky to plan for.

The sun was beaming so I went to have a swim and it was great.
