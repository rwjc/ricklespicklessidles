It rained the whole night. It continued through the day. Turns out there was a severe weather warning from MetService for Auckland and many other regions across New Zealand. This meant we weren’t going to get to kayak from Puhoi to Wenderholm today. Mark from Puhoi Canoe Hire texted me in the morning and had offered us a ride instead. Thanks Mark!

I got up early and had breakfast with Pip and her daughter Lily. She made me coffee, with milk fresh from their goats! It was so good.

Packing up a tent and all your stuff in the rain and wind is never fun. But we had a garage to hang them up to get them at least not dripping wet. Then Nicola and I set off. 

Mark dropped us off at Couldry House at Wenderholm regional park, where the kayak would have arrived at. We promised we I’ll come back at the end to complete this section, but only in superb weather.

The wind seems to have picked up even more as we started climbing. Rain poured as tracks become continuous streams themselves.

We soon got out to the highway. Luckily there was a segregated walkway for us. The only thing to battle against are the horizontal rain and strong winds. We made our way to Waiwera, where a small but well stocked dairy awaits.

We found a bus stop on the way there and we decided to take a bus over to Hatfields Beach, since the coastal way was impassable. It was due in 1 hour, so we took refuge at the dairy. We each bought a pie and some chocolate. When the scheduled time neared we reluctantly left the relative warmth of the dairy to the bleak bus stop shelter which did nothing to stop the wind and the rain. We met an Italian traveller who also had a huge backpack waiting as well. He was stuck in NZ and was hitchhiking everywhere to see the country. He would be moving a lot faster than us.

We got off the bus at Hatfields beach. We continued on foot. It was pretty cold; I actually welcomed the hill over to Orewa. It warmed us right up. 

My sister Jessica works in the middle of Orewa. Since it was lunchtime we met up at a cafe called Coast. Nicola carried on to Stillwater and was looking to be picked up by family to enjoy a good nights rest. Hopefully we’ll catch up again in or after Auckland.

Jess treated me with a great big lunch. She also dropped me off at Heather’s where I’ll be staying tonight. Thanks, you’re my favourite sister!

Weather-wise today was the most miserable day so far on the trail. But the hospitality of the people are what made it also an unforgettable experience. 

Locksley when he is calm (not a common occurrence I might add):

I hope the weather is more favourable tomorrow. I’m looking to get to Stillwater. Even though it’s not far away, I’d prefer to not have to go through today’s ordeal again.
