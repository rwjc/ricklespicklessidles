The rain that was promised had arrived throughout the night. Then in the morning it really started pouring. Not the best but still doable. It didn‚Äôt last long though. The weather for the rest of the day was quite pleasant.

After a small climb over Scott Point the Beach laid out to the horizon into the mist.

Yep. The NMB is pretty massive.

Met various wildlife on the beach for this long stretch. Alive and otherwise. (Mostly otherwise). Hammerhead sharks (baby size), rays, and pickup trucks.

Saw about 10 vehicles driving by. Most of them stopped by and made sure I‚Äôm okay. The people are super friendly and very curious. One even asked me for directions! (He wanted to see if he had already gone pass Te Paki, which is a stream. Yep, here you would just walk or drive across a free flowing stream). A DOC ranger also drove by and we had a long chat. The locals are lovely.

A tourist bus semi-full of tourists also came by. We waved at other. I can just imagine the guide picking up the microphone and pointing at me (obviously narrated by sir David Attenborough): ‚Äúand here we have a specimen of the fabled Te Araroa walker, who migrate from Cape Reinga to Bluff in Southland annually around this time. Why do they do this? No one knows.‚Äù

If you like photos of horses, here are some photos of horses. üê¥üê¥üê¥

I found the first group after following their hoof prints on the beach. After going over a little hill, they are just hanging around and grazing among some fields. I really enjoyed going off the path to see what‚Äôs out there.

The second group is very close to the campsite I was heading to. There were lots of them grazing around the area and you need to watch out for their poop when pitching your tent.

After setting up the tent at the campsite (has flush toilets and cold showered wow), Theo came storming in with his super light pack. He is a cold soaker and he volunteers at OTNZ and is from Palmerston North. He told me about Just Zilch which is an organisation that takes food from cafes and restaurants that would otherwise be dumped at the end of the day and give them to people FOR FREE. What a great idea. I will definitely go check it out when I get to Palmy. 

Later on Paul and Barbara came as well. Barbara had slipped earlier during the rain and had hurt her wrist. It looks bad. So after giving her some ibuprofen we discussed what they should do. They will try and contact someone and see if she can be picked up and go to a hospital. Hopefully they can resume the walk soon.
