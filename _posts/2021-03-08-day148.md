Even though some of the others who stayed at The Sanctuary last night were SOBOs, they got out at the Morrison Footbridge. This means they hadn’t done Mingha-Deception or the Goat Pass. So they all went out after breakfast to try to get a hitch. Tim got out first and succeeded. But Annelies, Devon, and Kiri surprisingly didn’t get a hitch before the cold got to them. It was really cold. They came back in to the warm fireplace of the lounge. Kiri had a hot water bottle and gloves. She had lost one of them so the other one was an Injinji toe sock. We asked about it; she misspoke and blurted out “toe shop”. That’s a trail name right there.

This was when Pia 🇩🇪 offered them a ride. She also stayed here and is not doing TA (which means she has a car and she does whatever she wants). She dropped them off and came back to give _me_ a ride to where I got to last time - The Bealey Hotel. Thanks Pia you’re the bomb!

Ahh, country road.

The trailhead.

It was 10 minutes to Bealey Hut. I met Dane. He is from Pukekohe, Auckland. Devon and Kiri told me about him. He’s got a feather on his hat, and he does hut to hut, the whole way NOBO. Wow. 

Saw this little bird walking up the side of the tree trunk. It’s really tiny. I wonder if it’s a rifleman.

Glorious.

So happy.

The Lagoon Saddle hut and A frame shelter. They are near each other, separated by a stream.

I had lunch in the A frame. Pizzas from the Wobbly Kea.

The trail follows (and crosses) the Harper River. It’s well maintained.

Flood Track, no thanks.

West Harper Hut. It’s super rustic.

Yeeeaaahhhh

A short side trip to see Mirror Tarn. I didn’t expect it to be so green. The Blue Lake in the Nelson Lakes had much better reflective qualities.

After a couple of swing bridges I got to Hamilton Hut, or as some call it, the Hamilton Hilton. It has triple deck bunks. Fireplace is grand. It’s a nice hut.

Turns out the Tararua Tramping Club was here (or a smallish contingent of them anyway). And Susan was with them! Apparently they changed plans in the last minute and a group of them decided to do this Track instead. So here we are. They are doing the circuit though and will be going out via the Cass saddle tomorrow so we won’t be going the same way. Normal people don’t do the TA route after Hamilton Hut since it’s supposedly terrible, at least Maé thought so anyway. 

A bit later on Alexa 🇺🇸 hiked in solo. She came over the Cass Saddle. She is from Minnesota and drives around NZ woofing and doing hikes. 

More moments later a couple came in as well. They are NOBOs but because the hut was chockabloc I didn’t get to talk to them. Unfortunately that’s what happens when huts get busy. 

Tomorrow: Harper Village.
