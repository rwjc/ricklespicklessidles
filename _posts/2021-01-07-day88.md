As forecasted there were a few drizzles throughout the night. But tent was dry in the morning which was good. After packing everything up I quickly got up to the saddle. I will need to descend into the valley below somehow. It is an unmarked route so hopefully the cairns will be there to show me the way. 

Mount Hopeless in the distance.

After some rocky bits there are campable places after the saddle (SOBO).

There were some snow at the bottom of a big boulder.

A lovely looking tarn.

I need to get down there somehow.

There are lots of bluffs and waterfalls. Be sure to follow the cairns! It would‚Äôve been a bit slower had the visibility been bad.

A steep scree slope at the end before hitting the valley.

A line of cairns that are pretty well placed leading into the bush.

Thanks for your service.

In the bush there‚Äôs a marked track - Hopeless Track.

The track went alongside the Hopeless Creek.

![IMG_2325](/assets/images/20210107/img_2325.jpg)

I got to Hopeless Hut after about 2 hours. 

![IMG_2324](/assets/images/20210107/img_2324.jpg)

![IMG_2326](/assets/images/20210107/img_2326.jpg)

The bottom bunks have double-size mattresses! I‚Äôve never seen that before.

Piwakawaka.

Hopeless sign.

![IMG_2339](/assets/images/20210107/img_2339.jpg)

At the junction I rejoin the official track of TA. Alternate route completed. 

![IMG_2342](/assets/images/20210107/img_2342.jpg)

Nice little cascading waterfalls.

![IMG_2344](/assets/images/20210107/img_2344.jpg)

I got to John Tait Hut and had lunch here. There were
Lots of sleeping bags and packs plus two tents outside, but there was nobody here. They must have gone out (I found out later when I met a lady further on that they did a day trip to Cupola Hut). 

![IMG_2346](/assets/images/20210107/img_2346.jpg)

Inquisitive robin. 

![IMG_2352](/assets/images/20210107/img_2352.jpg)

Travers Falls is really nice. If the weather was hot I‚Äôd definitely go down and have a swim. 

![IMG_2356](/assets/images/20210107/img_2356.jpg)

![IMG_2359](/assets/images/20210107/img_2359.jpg)

The track has mostly been pretty well maintained and good to walk on. Only for the last few km where it started to climb a bit. Soon I reached Upper Travers Hut. 

![IMG_2368](/assets/images/20210107/img_2368.jpg)

There‚Äôs a power socket here. Probably as a joke...

![IMG_2375](/assets/images/20210107/img_2375.jpg)

There were a few people here already. I met TA NOBOs Eilish and Rob as well as her dad Stephen. I asked about about the passes they just came through. Should be fun. 

I also met Petrus üá´üáÆ who is originally from Finland and has been living in Fran Josef for the last 10 years. He works for DOC on Kakapo conservation. 

More and more people came in throughout the afternoon. The full got really full. I heard that in West Sabine hut last night there were 45 people!

Ciara üáÆüá™ also popped in. I first met her at Smiths Farm near Anikiwa. She is really fun to chat to. 

Paul üá≥üáø (a new one) also got in. He section hiked the TA for three years and this year he will complete it. He has done everything section already (including Bluff and getting the medal) but only this part from St Arnaud to Boyle remain. He will finish it soon. 

Tomorrow: Blue Lake Hut.
