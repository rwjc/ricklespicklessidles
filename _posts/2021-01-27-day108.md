Rest day @ Twizel. 

I woke up feeling great. 

The day was spent visiting _all_ the shops in town, eating at cafes, eating leftovers, drinking. 

Shopping for suitable headgear.

Such a tender moment.

Enormous power.

Town centre.

I searched for nearby walks. There was only one I found. The Twizel River Trail. It’s quite long. We didn’t go far since there’s no need to go anywhere. I wanted to see the river and potentially have a dip.

What we found though were uninterested alpacas.

We sat beside the river and chatted. It’s probably okay to swim but it was not far downstream from the alpacas and it wasn’t too hot. So I didn’t.

I went to the local community library which was attached to the school. There was a painting there. It reminded me of trogdor.

We wound up at a pub. Lots of people brought their dogs. It was great.
