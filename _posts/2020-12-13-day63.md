The shelter was warm in the night and we were not attacked by rats (there were comments about this possibility). 

Off we go in the last day of this Palmy-Levin section. Afterwards it’ll be the Tararuas proper.

We are here, finally!

A car pulled by and asked if we wanted a lift. It’s was really early and we politely declined. Soon we arrived at the bush on the Mangahao-Makahika Track. It was opened in 2008 by Helen Clark.

It was like yesterday. Very nice bush, some muddy parts but that is now accepted as standard New Zealand tramping track and it is normal. Some river crossings but more manageable than the day before.

Tahlia went on a mission of trying to keep her shoes dry. Sometimes she built bridges by throwing rocks across the stream to hop onto. Genny and I helped but it’s ultimately futile. One by one they joined me in my wetfoot clan. There’s essentially no chance of crossing some of the streams without getting them fully submerged. It’s usually more fun anyway.

Lunch at the Horowhenua Lookout. Some poor plants were the victim of being used to wipe mid off our shoes. Tahlia made some backcountry gourmet finger foods and Genny gave me some wraps for me to put my tuna in. I added honey just for the heck of it and it turned out alright. Just don’t add too much!

After the bush track we got onto farm land. It was gorsy and muddy and is generally unpleasant. 

Genny vs cow. Cow pussied out.

Tahlia and a part of the farm that was not entirely terrible.

Soon we reached the Makahika Outdoor Pursuits Centre. It’s a big place with lodges and cabins and lots of things to teach kids skills for the outdoors. At a shelter made specifically for TA hikers (with a fantastic hot shower). There we saw the boxes Karen brought for us. We had given her our resupply and she happened to be coming up this way (to GPS the mud on the tracks). Thanks to her we can continue on our way without going into Levin to get more food.

We wanted to get a cabin together if possible but the owners were not in. Their dogs were though. We could only see them through the window it was obvious they really wanted to come outside and get some pats. We really wanted that as well.

A caretaker came to feed and take the dogs for a walk and we finally got to play with them briefly.

John, one of the owners, came home and we introduced ourselves. Unfortunately all the cabins have been booked. Apparently there is a gigantic school camp tomorrow - 150 kids. That’s a lot of kids. He let us charge our electronics in his home. Thanks John! We rented by the shelter.
