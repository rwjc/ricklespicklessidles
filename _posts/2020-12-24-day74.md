The quirky and fun Atlantis Backpackers give free breakfast at 8am (and dessert at 7pm - last nights was chocolate mouse). But we had to miss it since that’s when our water taxi was scheduled.

Bye picton! (for now). At the ferry terminal we met two TA hikers - Alex and Abbie. They are SOBO and they are only doing the South Island.

Ship Cove. The start of our section on the Queen Charlotte track. There’s a Cook monument here.

The first day had been reasonably flat. A few small hills here and there but nothing bad. We meandered around the coast and we had great views.

Genny and I had lunch at a beach. There are many like it. The water is very clear.

Swing bridge! But I was disappointed it didn’t swing.

A rusty tractor.

Camp Bay campsite. Pretty nice. Flush toilets and toilet paper - wheat more do you need?

We did go to the lodges nearby to see if they have a dorm room. They don’t really and the cheapest options are out of our range. So we went back to the DOC campsite. 

More and more people came in. Most of whole have done the same thing we did today from Ship Cove. There was one other TA hiker. I’ve not yet gotten his name. 

Alex and Abbie use Aarn packs. Genny was interested in trying out it and the boob bags.
