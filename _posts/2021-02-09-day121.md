title: Day 121&#58; Greenstone with a twist
description: side trip done, rejoined the trail. We waited for the rain to ease before setting off on the Greenstone Track. A short day but not the easiest.

Morena. 

Heavy rain. Do not want to get wet. It’s supposed to ease off in the afternoon. We slept in and spent some quality time in the hut. We need more hut games. I read more of my book - [Tiamat’s Wrath](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28335698-tiamat-s-wrath). They just killed off my favourite character! Bastards!

Had lunch in the hut. Just before noon the rain eased a little bit. CRAB let’s go! Check out Alex’s ultralight rain skirt.

Misty and wet. Just how I like my valley.

I didn’t have a good day today. My chafing came back with a bang. I did however wore my undies on Catherine’s suggestion. Just to clarify my [Patagonia Baggies](https://www.patagonia.com/shop/mens-baggies) has a liner which usually houses my junk. But it’s not very resistant to the chafe train. The undies helped. 

To make things worse I twisted my ankle a few hundred metres from McKellar Hut after we set off. It wasn’t the worst but it is definitely annoying. I hobbled and wobbled and felt generally sorry for myself. 

Greenstone Hut. Thank all the goodness that is in this world. It’s also a very nice hut. Not as good as McKellar but it’s right up there.

Mushrooms by the meat safe.

We played a game called SPRING. Each person needs to say a word that is connected in someway to the previous word. But you cannot say a word that begins with the letters in SPRING, or if it has already been said. Initially it’s just S, but each time someone messed up a new letter is added to the blacklist. I was doing really well until I crashed by doing the stupidest things imaginable. Catherine won. She is forcing me to write down that she won. I am coerced. 

We met some NOBOs in the hut. Also Paulie was here but he continued to the next hut. Charlotte was here last night but apparently she wasn’t feeling so well (we heard from passers by that she coughed blood) and she went back out with Keith. I hope she is alright. 

A DOC ranger was also stationed here. He recorded everyone’s tickets and hut passes and our planned routes. This is the second time this has happened to me on the trail. The first one was at Blue Lake Hut in Nelson Lakes with the “obviously” guy. 

Damn my forehead tanline is still there.

New trail name for Alex: Goody 2 Shoes. He carries around 2 pair of shoes and Catherine thought he is a good person. Another that was floated around was Avocado Binge. Alex is vegan and that’s what he does. 

Tomorrow: Careys Hut hopefully
