Bog Inn Hut to Piropiro Campsite

21.79km ~ 4:53

![IMG_3892](/assets/images/20201121/img_3892.jpg)

Today has 2 parts - walking the Timber Trail, and spending quality time at Timber Trail Lodge.

Last night was also very cold. But I was well prepared by already wearing a fleece and sleep socks (necessary luxury). So I had another great quality sleep.

A little bush track climbing out from Bog Inn Hut, then I resumed the Timber Trail going south.

The suggested times on this trail‚Äôs signs are strange. They are definitely not cycling times, but they are way too generous for walking as well. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Swing bridges galore. I was disappointed that they don‚Äôt swing enough. 

I was just being a tourist sight seeing on a bridge where I found a couple of hunters and their adorable dog.

They named it ‚Äúdog‚Äù....

They hadn‚Äôt caught anything so far in the morning. I wished them well and went back on the trail.

Having the name ‚ÄùCamp Epic‚Äù I just had to go and stay there. But it _is_ Saturday so my chances are not good.

I arrived at Timber Trail Lodge at 12:30pm. Their kitchen opens at 1pm. Pretty good timing!

Their staff are very friendly. A lot of young people who are all from overseas stuck here due to COVID-19.

I got in when they were having their lunch before they start work. But they welcomed me in and made me feel like home. (To be honest it‚Äôs much nicer than my home).

I then had a nice lunch! Hot pizza!

I stayed and chilled out in the lounge while charging my electronics. As time went on more and more mountain bikers came in. Some came for a beer and moved on, but most came to stay. They usually come in looking quite tired and very sweaty. More sweaty than me! I think it‚Äôs easier for walkers to just stop and sit down. Bikers would probably want to push on faster and longer.

E-bikes are the future. 

I also met the managers Angie and Garth. They were very friendly and helpful. I told them I was going to stay at Camp Epic and they suggested calling them first. There was no service so I used their landline to call Paul the manager of that campsite. Unfortunately they were full to the brim (no hot shower for me tonight üò¢). I inquired about renting a bike tomorrow to ride down all the way to the end of the trail at Ongarue. They have a spot! Looks like I‚Äôll be on two wheels tomorrow.

I talked to one of the staff who is also a keen hiker. He‚Äôs done a lot of the Great Walks and he gave me his ranking of them in order of how great he thought they were. His favourite was Routeburn. Before I left he gave me a lunch wrap he made for someone who cancelled in the last minute. It tasted really good!

The Piropiro DOC campsite is huge. It is also free and accessible from the road. That means it can get very busy on weekends. There are lots of families, hunters, other campers. It‚Äôs quite loud. Hopefully it‚Äôll get quieter at night.

Wayne also soon strolled in. He didn‚Äôt get to Bog Inn Hut last night and stayed at a shelter before it. So he had a longer day today. He was glad to get here.

There are lots of bird here that I‚Äôve not seen or heard farther north. Kakas are abundant here. We even saw some NZ falcons (karearea).

Tomorrow: Ongarue (probably)
