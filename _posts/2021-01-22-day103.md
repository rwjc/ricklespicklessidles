Morning morning morning.

Catherine and I went back to the junction via the track, Malcolm and Ciara went on a “shortcut”. They got there first. We were pretty close though. 

Today’s track mainly goes through the Hukatere Conservation Park. It’s mostly 4wd and some farm tracks. Large expanses with big mountain ranges as backdrop.

There were also some road walking too.

The damage done by the spikey bois the days before.

The sun was blistering hot. We found a really good lunch spot with some shelter to the wind and running stream nearby.

We needed to get to the carpark by 5pm. That’s when Wayne from Alps 2 Ocean is scheduled to pick up hikers. The group in front of us have booked it. We haven’t. We planned to show up and see what’s up.

On a small ridge somewhere.

Catherine walks really fast.

The trail is visible in the grass down the hill. We took a nice shortcut.

Ooo mystery lake.

In the last 5km or so Malcolm started to run. He zoomed past us with his big pack on his back and his prowess was on display. He was in full flight. He came third in the Queenstown half marathon. He’s a beast. 

The great Rangitata River. We were almost there to the car park. 

![IMG_3489](/assets/images/20210122/img_3489.jpg)

At the car park we met up with waiting hikers. Keith (we returned his hat and sunnies which he left at the hut; he looked relieved), Kate and Ed whom I met back at St Arnaud, Turbo Ben, and of course, Sexy Chris (that’s what we call him now; long story).  

Just before 5 Wayne rolled up with his van. Genny and Charlotte were somehow already inside. Unfortunately for us there were only 2 free seats. We got Catherine and Ciara to go with them first to reserve a bunk for us. Wayne will come back and get us in 2 hours to get us to Geraldine. It was very nice of him.

So it’s Malcolm and I hanging out at the car park. 

I was told this is the hill used for the Golden Halls of Rohan in the Lord of the Rings.
