It rained throughout the night. It‚Äôs hard to tell how heavy it actually was. The roar of the Whakapapa River is so loud that sometimes I wake up thinking it was pouring down but instead it was just a drizzle. Despite this I had a good sleep.

The 42nd Traverse (or the 42 Traverse) is a 4WD track on mostly gravel. It has a number of river crossings. The TA goes for about 22km before changing onto the Waione / Cokers track which is narrower and muddier.

After all the rain and thick overcast I was surprised when the sun actually came out. Hopefully it will dry up the muddier bits I was expecting coming up.

There were numerous possible campsites along the traverse. It‚Äôs always a good idea to make note of them and comment on Guthook or just through word of mouth to share their locations. This is one example (1078.3km):

Mt. Ruahpehu!

There were lots of river crossings. Some of them went up to thigh high and the water current was quite strong.

Whione / Cockers track. There were some steep parts with exposed clay. It can be pretty slippery. Would be much worse if it is was raining.

I have been following a couple of footprints for most of the day. They looked fresh and since it rained a lot in the last few days it‚Äôs very likely they are from today. And in the afternoon I finally caught up to them - Fi and Sonya.

They are section hikers on their second day of their first TA section! First night they camped where we camped yesterday, and last night they camped in the forest before one of the river crossings because yesterday it was impassable due to the water level. 

After coming out of the track, a small road walk led me to a power line track that connects to a well groomed path for the Te Porere Redoubts. Brian had made me excited about reading up on the history of the pas and redoubts along the trail.

On the way to the holiday park I saw the helicopter that was circling around earlier. It had landed. I later heard that they had picked up somebody in the forest and transferred them to an ambulance. I really hope it‚Äôs not anyone I know. And regardless of whether I know them I hope they recover soon.

I checked in to the holiday park. I learnt about the weather for tomorrow. It doesn‚Äôt look good ü§®

No bowl, no problem!

Fi and Sonya, great to meet you!

There are a bunch of people here doing the crossing tomorrow. Other that the TA peeps there is a French group and an English group. Since we are going in different directions on the crossing I wonder where we will meet.

Tomorrow: if weather allows Tongariro Crossing SOBO
