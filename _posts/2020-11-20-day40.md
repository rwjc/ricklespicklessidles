43.56km ~ 9:52 (first time breaking 40!)

Mangaokewa to Bog Inn Hut, Pureora

Last night was really cold all of a sudden. It woke me up.

But I had a fantastic sleep. Look at all those REM cycles üëÄ

Sunrise, breakfast, and go!

First task of the day: get water from under a bridge (we wild camped last night). Not the easiest to get to.

The first 25km was all road, even a good chunk by SH30 ‚òπÔ∏è.

Caught red handed

I can confirm that the sign is accurate.

Pureora, today‚Äôs destination. Looks so far away!

And we‚Äôre here!

Slowly chipping away at the honey:

I lied down on the grass and tried to have a little nap before tackling the Timber trail. 30 seconds in a bike packer rolled him and said hello. I got up and we talked for awhile. He took out his lunch - a pizza. It smelled so good. He must have seen my longing face because he offered me some! He had it rolled up to fit in his panniers.

Cold pizza is the best (when you don‚Äôt have hot pizza).

The trail started out super nice. Great bush, gentle gradient (it‚Äôs a cycle trail), lots of birds. Then it went through some private land where there is no timber. But later on it wound its way back into the shade, which was so good because the sun was so hot.

Umm thanks DOC.

To get to the summit you need to take the Tio Tio Track which is a tramping track, so the bike path doesn‚Äôt go to the top.

The view at the Pureora summit is very very good. Worth the extra time to get up there (and get down). Weather was perfect as well. In the distance you can see Lake Taupo, Mt Ruapehu and Mt Ngauruhoe.

The way down TA takes us through an unmaintained track. Thanks TA! But it wasn‚Äôt too bad; not compared to what I‚Äôve already experienced...

Beautiful trees.

It has been a long day, and I don‚Äôt want to get to camp dark. But it has definitely taken longer than I expected to get to Bog Inn hut from the summit.

The hut is old and rustic. In other words, it has charm. I‚Äôm staying in my tent though which I find is the coziest place.
