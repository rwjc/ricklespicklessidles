Totara Heights to Rangiriri

32km ~ 8:58

Plus about 48km hitch to Mercer.

(By the way there is no South Auckland, part two, because one part is enough).

Last night my sister and Jake came to drop off a new pair of shoes. And it‚Äôs on a workday; thanks so much! It‚Äôs got yellow rims which should make me go faster üôÑ. My previous pair lasted 600 or so km and the outsoles have pretty much lost their grip. The new ones are perfect to start  Waikato with.

Hugo has a 3 kg of honey. I ate it (with toast).

See you Rudi!

Hugo dropped off Lili and I early in the morning at Mercer, before he went to work. What a champ!

The first challenge of the day was the Whangamerino track. Oh boy. 

![IMG_3032](/assets/images/20201111/img_3032.jpg)

The track was not well maintained (coincidentally just when we got out two DOC rangers drove up and were there to do some track maintenance). Long grass, gorse, and even knee-high swamps are rampant.

One highlight though was on a picnic table coming out of the track. Set up by a girl (I heard) who lived by the track, were a jar of lolly cakes and an honest jar. Of course I bought and ate one.

The next challenge was State Highway 1. First we needed to cross it, as well as a train track. We went underneath both.

</div>

We followed the highway for awhile. Then we turned away and started following a ‚Äútrack‚Äù next to the Waikato river. On paper it sounded great and I was even looking forward to it. It is actually terrible. It was even worse than the first one. It was very slow going. Until of course we started to not follow the ‚Äútrail‚Äù and just go into the paddocks.

Sometimes there are cows, sometimes there are calves, and sometimes there are bulls. What‚Äôs in common though are electric fences. Often there are no gates or stiles so we‚Äôd have to either roll under the fence or step and duck through the middle space. I was shocked a few times.

We saw many pesty carps among the grass in the water of the river. I heard later that DOC had arranged a bow & arrow hunt of them the other day and they extracted five tonnes of these beasts.

There was a nice section along the river, and then a sketchy sidle where it was muddy and slippery right above the water. We both slipped and got at least a foot in the water.

Some more pleasant images by the Waikato river. On the way we unexpectedly met TA hikers Scott and Jane. They are from New Plymouth and walk pretty fast.

Back on the road, we got to a pump station where they supplied to us probably the cleanest water in the whole country. Just follow the instructions and you will no longer be thirsty.

The rest of the way to Rangiriri was a straight up road walk. It was boring so podcasts came out. At least the road was very quiet. 

Not sure what this is supposed to be:

![IMG_3100](/assets/images/20201111/img_3100.jpg)

Just go in any direction you please:

Soon we got to the famous (to TA hikers) Rangiriri Pie Shop. It‚Äôs run by Cathy and she is super friendly. She said normally by this time of the year she would‚Äôve served around 150 hikers; but this year only about 25 including us. Such a shame, because her pies are legendary.

I got a beer and a mutton mushroom pie. It was massive.

Then we heard there were dessert pies as well! So we got apple pie and a chocolate mix (Nutella, Jaffa, ...) as half & half.

It hit every spot there is to hit.

Jane and Scott likes to live in luxury so they got a room at the pub. We camped behind it. It was sunny!

Tomorrow we will get to Huntly.
