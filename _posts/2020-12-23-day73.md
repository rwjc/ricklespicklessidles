Wellington to Picton

Today’s itinerary: get to the train station; pick up a parcel from Vipul (my shoes); get to the ferry terminal; get to Picton; do resupply for the Richmond ranges and anything else I still need for the Queen Charlotte track; pack stuff; eat; sleep. 

Susan took us in her spanking new car. Driving through the little narrow windy streets of hilly Welly was an interesting experience (for me). 

At the train station, I pumped into Alex! We first met at the OTNZ river safety course in early October. He’s looking to take a train back to Auckland for Christmas. I think that train takes 8 hours. He was surprised I was continuing. Yeah I understand.

Then Vipul came to give me the parcel. I had shipped it to his place. I didn’t expect it to arrive so early. He was on his way to work. It’s starting to be a bit hazy for me to remember what that is.

The ferry terminal was really close. It felt like so many farewells in so little time. Susan had helped and hosted us for the past few days. It would be fantastic if she had announced publicly to be a trail angel. I think if she isn’t so active and being away so often she may very well do that. It’s much needed in the heart of Wellington.

Finally on the ferry.

Not the greatest of weathers.

After arriving we had a nice lunch to celebrate the memory that was the north island.

We stayed at Atlantis Backpackers. Sheira, one of the owners of the place is from New York. She is probably the most eccentric woman I’ve ever met. She is also incredibly fun to talk to.

There’s a one-legged cat that had its own bunk bed.

Absolutely ridiculous.

Not too terrible.

We met Alexis, who is Canadian and she had been NOBOing the South Island. Her last stage is the Queen Charlotte track. She is staying in Picton for Christmas though. I’ve been learning a lot about her experiences of the Richmond ranges and other tracks in the south like wasps and rats. She said she haven’t had a problem. She also said that she met a big group of SOBOs of about 20 in the Richmond ranges. They are about 1.5 weeks ahead. In total she said she has met about 50 and only one other going northbound. 

Tomorrow: the QC.
