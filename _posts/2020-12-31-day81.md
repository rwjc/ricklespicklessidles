description: day of all sorts. Sidling alongside the river upstream. Climbed through big maroon jagged rocks onto a ridge and sidled across a scree field. Briefly sidled around Mt Ellis summit. Came back down and walked alongside another river and eventually a steep hill climb to the hut.

Mid Wairoa Hut to Hunters Hut

Three little tents. I slept in the hut. Like a king. But then Jack 🇳🇱 got up at 5:30am and I did not expect that.

The first part of today was going to be alongside Wairoa River Left Branch. Lots of sidles with small footpaths. One time there was even a wire.

The river looks amazing.

There were many wasp nests along the way. We saw one in a log fell right over the track. We tried to clear the ground before it and wrote “wasp” with stone. I don’t think we did a good job.

There were 8 river crossings. None of them were difficult. But we also didn’t have any rain for a long time.

Genny’s favourite activity - going through nestled branches.

A waterfall.

We had lunch at Top Wairoa Hut.

A solo wasp making a nest on the inside of the door to the toilet. Jack killed it with a stick.

After lunch we started the climb into Red Hills country. It is very rocky. The rocks are reddish and are quite abrasive. My poor shoes.

Jack coming up behind us.

Mt Ellis in the distance. 

![IMG_1844](/assets/images/20201231/img_1844.jpg)

The Red Hills Range in the back. 

![IMG_1850](/assets/images/20201231/img_1850.jpg)

Love this.

The trail didn’t actually take us to the summit of Mt Ellis. It went around it. Unfortunately for us the clouds decided to roll in as well. 

![IMG_1866](/assets/images/20201231/img_1866.jpg)

We descended from the tops. Went along another river.

Arrived at Hunters Hut. 

![IMG_1904](/assets/images/20201231/img_1904.jpg)

The hut has a nice view of Mt Ellis. We could see where we came from. It was great. 

![IMG_1890](/assets/images/20201231/img_1890.jpg)

There was a pot of food people left over for free. 

![IMG_1889](/assets/images/20201231/img_1889.jpg)

Hiker glossary.

LotR banter in the intentions book. 

![IMG_1892](/assets/images/20201231/img_1892.jpg)

I tried some dehy mushrooms from the Asian stores in Wellington. They are so good. 

![IMG_1896](/assets/images/20201231/img_1896.jpg)

Grayson 🇺🇸 brought cheesecake (dehy but from the states. It’s legit) for NYE! Steve added some m&ms. Walter 🇩🇪 has all the whisky. But he didn’t come to this hut today. He stayed back at Top Wairoa Hut. 

Happy New Years Eve!
