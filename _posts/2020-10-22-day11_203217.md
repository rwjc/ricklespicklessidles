Hone Heke Lodge, Kerikeri to Pickled Parrot, Paihia

29.92km ~ 7:38 (with a detour around Waitangi treaty grounds)

Despite what the weather forecast said, I only got a few drizzles in the afternoon. Looks like we can do the kayak tomorrow after all.

Yesterday I actually didn‚Äôt do the full trail to the Kerikeri. I turned off a bit early. So this morning I had to go back and start from where I left off. This let Lili go off with a huge advantage and I never caught her until the lodge.

The rest of the Kerikeri riverside walk was as spectacular as the ones I‚Äôve done so far.

Coming out of the riverside walk, I met a couple going on their morning walk/run. The man complemented on the state of my legs (!), and is quite knowledgeable about the trail. I asked them about the sections coming up. Apparently it‚Äôs been pretty dry up here so they were actually looking forward to the rain (but I wasn‚Äôt!).

After a short road section out of Kerikeri, I came onto the Waitangi forestry tracks. It is a forest for logging so at the beginning it‚Äôs pretty terrible, with massive machineries and half barren landscapes. But shortly the TA was directed to a long section where they are not harvesting. The road becomes pretty good to walk pn, covered by thick pine needles layers.

After the Forest track, I came across the TA opening plaque. Thanks Jim!

After more kms on the road a car pulled by and asked me if I wanted a lift. He was going away from Paihia so I thanked him and said no. But soon he turned around and came back and offer me again. He seemed genuine so I accepted. I told him I actually wanted to go see the Waitangi Treaty Grounds which was just about 1 km down the road. He said no problem. It turned out that he wants to help me because he wanted to sell some things to me... anyway, we arrived at the place and I thanked them. The grounds and all the exhibitions at the museums are really well done. I had a very pleasant time relaxing and learning about this significant part of our history in more detail.

After Waitangi I strolled towards Paihia. I stepped onto the sands of Te Ti Bay. It‚Äôs a beach on the east coast! It brought back memories on 90 Mile Beach, except now the sand slopes leftward (in the direction I was walking). Luckily for me it was only a few hundred metres.

At the end of the day I stayed at Pickled Parrot. It‚Äôs a fabulous place. I definitely could spent many nights here. I found Lili chilling in the common room. All the sofas look really inviting. I haven‚Äôt sat in one for 11 days.

There are lots of artwork with TA humour, e.g. the scales for all the gram weenies out there.

Can‚Äôt go wrong with steak and asparagus.

Oh and we went to countdown earlier to get a 6 day resupply for the next section. Fun heavy packs here we come.

Tomorrow we‚Äôve booked a kayak to get to Waikare. Fingers crossed ü§û.
