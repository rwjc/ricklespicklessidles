title: Day 82&#58; Richmond Ranges 6️⃣ final countdown
description: undulating and meandering through Red Hill tussock and rivers. Finally some mud. Thought I could get through the Ranges without much mud but there it is.

Hunters Hut to Red Hills Hut

18.9km ~ 8:36

Morning.

Shortly after the clouds cleared and the sky turned blue. 

![IMG_1912](/assets/images/20210101/img_1912.jpg)

Back on rocky terrain. 

![IMG_1915](/assets/images/20210101/img_1915.jpg)

Going down testing the footing.

Maybe someone has camped here on the saddle.

Genny photobombed Jack and me!

Porters Creek Hut. It’s quite neat. Lots of good tent spaces too. We had a snack break here.

Sidling again.

Sliding this time.

On a river bed.

Happy valley. In a land before time, maybe. 🦕

Cannot help myself. 

![IMG_1955](/assets/images/20210101/img_1955.jpg)

Came across this “spa-sized” pool (according to Guthook comments). Had lunch here and a little dip.

🌸 🌺 💐

The sun was out in full force. It was really hot. The last few ks I sped up and rushed to the hut. To slow me down the mountain gave us lots of mud and boggy bits. Thanks.

Red Hills Hut is also very nice. Looks quite new. It’s got a screen on the windows! So good! That’s what Hunters Hut sorely needed.

Grayson whipped out her chocolate to share and it had started to melt already in the hot sun. So we used our fingers.

Met a couple of section hikers. Bat 🇫🇷 (it’s short for something but I forgot) and Torie 🇺🇸. Torie lived in Colorado and has done 30 of the 14ers. She’s an outdoor guide. 

Sam and Louise got in “fashionably late”. Since the weather was turning we all helped them set up their tent. Must have been some sort of record time for putting it up. Grayson also boiled some water for them so they could start making dinner ASAP. Hikers unite!

All turned in for the night.
