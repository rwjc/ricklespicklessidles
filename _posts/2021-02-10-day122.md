title: Day 122&#58; Mavora Bogway
description: A reasonably better day than the previous two. It was much drier in the sky, but not so much on the ground. Pretty boggy for half of the way. Otherwise quite fast going.

It didn‚Äôt rain in the morning. Success.

Lots of cloud cover though.

Catherine used my sports tape I carried all the way from Cape Reinga to tape up a wound on her knee.

Due to the rain in the past few days the track is extra boggy.

Not all bogs look this clear.

Taipo Hut. It‚Äôs cute. It also has a turnstile.

Tussocky.

Catherine doing a stream crossing. She actually fell in the water. Not all the way, but it was funny.

Bumped into Paulie üáÆüá™ at Boundary Hut. This hut is infamous. It has a broken window, the long drop is actually a zero drop, and the water tank is unusable. Everyone avoids staying here. We just had lunch and moved on.

We past quite a few NOBOs. The more south we go the fresher and more innocent they are.

North Mavora Lake.

Careys Hut. It‚Äôs really nice. But there are lots of sandflies. 

![IMG_4652](/assets/images/20210210/img_4652.jpg)

Ciara, Joe and Caleb left us a message.

Turbo Ben loved the smell of his Radix.

Three more NOBOs came to the hut. You‚Äôre never sure if the hut will be full or not since you have no way to tell if NOBOs are coming. Last night there was 15 hikers at this hut. Tonight there is 7. 

Alex introduced a card game to us. It has an Italian name. It sounds like Cambino but I always get it wrong. We had fun. I did a me where I started off really well but then I crashed and came in last. I miss winning. 

Tomorrow: Kiwi Burn Hut or manage somehow to hitch to Te Anau.
