One more rest day in the Tasman area. 

I went into town again to post my resupply box to Boyle Village. I packed it last night. Hopefully it gets there. 

Fruity breakfast.

Just outside the library.

For lunch I caught up with Brian and Kelly again. They drove down from Mapua. Just so it happens Bay Dreams was just starting. There were tonnes of people in town. We went slightly out of town to Branford Park to make some quick lunch.

I was thinking of going to do the nearby track to the Centre of New Zealand monument. But I ended up skipping it. Maybe next time!

After dinner Trevor took me to do some hunting. We picked up his friend Julian and went to his family farm which is quite near St. Arnaud. It’s massive. We drove around on his ute to look for deer. We didn’t see any. We saw some pigs and goats but deer is where it’s at. 

This is Kate, mom of Toon.

Scoping out some goats.

We found a big field mushroom.

On a hill looking for deer that is not in a farm.

Apparently it was still early. Deer here tend to come out at dusk. So we went to Trevor’s parents place and had a cup of tea and some biscuits. They are really nice. 

When it got dark we went back out. I became the spotlight and we drove around the farm to look for blue eyes. We saw cats, rabbits, and possums. But unfortunately no deer.

We got back after midnight. I was so tired.
