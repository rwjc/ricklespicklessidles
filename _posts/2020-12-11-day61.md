Palmy to Moturimu Whare campsite

32.4km ~ 8:38

![IMG_0304](/assets/images/20201211/img_0304.jpg)

Weather report: fine but bloody windy. This made sense because we‚Äôre getting closer and closer to Wellington. 

The bridge out of Palmy:

The trail today consists of: road, small roadside trails, farm tracks, mountain bike track, and forestry roads.

Happy to be on trail üòä

Into the valley. Into the wind. The strongest wind I‚Äôve faced so far.

Mushroom.

A reserve along the way where we had lunch. You can camp here but I think a slightly better campsite is a bit further down by the entrance to the mountain bike park.

There are lots of mountain bike tracks here. The one we walk through is called the ‚ÄúBack Track‚Äù which I assume is called that because it goes around the back of everything since nobody wants stinking hikers clogging up their cycle trails.

This track turned out to be really nice.

This photo is blurry because I was going too fast and not because I am bad at photography.

Not long into this track is a monument for the halfway mark! It‚Äôs technically for the 2016/17 season but it‚Äôs pretty close this year. We had a small break celebrating with some little bottle of fiery whiskey Tahlia brought with her.

**HALF WAY FYEAH**

The forestry track took us through some pretty impressive sceneries.

There are a lot of non hikers who come through here who are really trigger happy.

When we got to the campsite Whare (it‚Äôs really good, except being doorless) Genny was there to welcome us in. She had started today at the bridge (which we had to walk to from the trail angels place) and we‚Äôve never caught up to here until now. She is fun to chat to and has done lots of hiking here and back home in the UK.

Whare without Genny and with some chairs we put at the entrance to try and disrupt any incoming wind.

Sunset was excellent.

Tomorrow is a short day instead of distance but may not be short in terms of time. There could be some serious river crossings but it‚Äôs better to have others with you for safety. Hopefully the water levels will be safe enough tomorrow.
