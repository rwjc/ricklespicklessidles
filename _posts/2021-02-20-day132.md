32.37km ~ 7:35

Invercargill to Bluff, Stirling Point

- Invercargill Estuary Walkway

This is the day. Bluff all the way to the end. 

Big breakfast for a big boi.

The morning was quite foggy. It makes the estuary walk atmospheric and eerie.

Then it cleared right up. Perfect weather, for road walking. Despite what some people have said, it‚Äôs not sketchy. There are lots of room to give to incoming vehicles.

Ben and I stopped at this grassy junction for lunch. I brought a beef sandwich from the cafe. Charlotte came shortly after. Right at this moment Keith drove up with Catherine and surprised us with goodies.

They gave Ben a punnet of strawberries, Charlotte a cream bun and a coke, and me a pie. They know us so well.

Off we go again. There were lots of cars who drove by honking and waving (and sometimes yelling) congratulating us on finishing. The locals would know about the TA and probably see hikers all the time. It felt really good.

The town of Bluff.

I got a bit emotional walking up to this sign which is at the edge of the town.

I had ice cream when I got to the first dairy. Here I bumped into Harry (whom I met on the Deception River / Goat Pass Hut). Apparently his dad Ross is up ahead.

By coincidence there is a street art exhibition happening at Bluff right now. We walked past a group of people who were ogling at an artist in his element but then they surrounded Charlotte and I asking enthusiastically about the trail. Some of them even started clapping at one point. So embarrassing.

Charlotte and I are Team Both Islands. Ciara, Duncan, and Alex are too but they were behind us somewhere.

Here we go! The moment we‚Äôve all been waiting for.

Ben‚Äôs mom Sharon had driven here from Dunedin to meet up with him. She also chaperoned us around to catch up with the stragglers, and taking us back to Stirling Point for a group photo. It‚Äôs really nice of her. Thank you so much Sharon!

Harry‚Äôs parents are here already. When everyone was here we got our photo.

I was wearing the medal that the TA Trust has provided for the walkers. It feels strange to put it on myself so Charlotte did it for me in a made up cheesy ceremony.

Tonight will go off. 

Tomorrow: rest day at Invercargill, and probably lots of goodbyes üò¢. 

For my lovely readers, it‚Äôs been my pleasure to have you join me on my journey. I‚Äôm just letting you know that this will not be the last post. I‚Äôm planning to do the Northern circuit in Stewart Island (if it works out, I haven‚Äôt fully committed yet), and then fill the 66km section that is marked TBD in the table below. Then I‚Äôm thinking of doing a tips/summary post that may be useful for future aspiring TA hikers. Also, a fun video is coming üòâ (in time) which should be a good complement to all the photos in these posts. You may not care about all that which is absolute fine. I‚Äôve really enjoyed jotting down my ramblings at night. Thanks again for reading, and stay tuned for the extras!
