Ocean Beach camp to Ruakaka Beach holiday park

32km ~ 9:34 (lots of eating and waiting)

The bird life in Bream Head is magnificent. That’s how I like to be woken up.

Today we have a decent climb since the Northland forests. And it was pouring down. I donned my rain jacket for only the second time since I started the TA, and was absolutely drenched, in rain and in sweat.

The bush was really lush and green. The area is also known for great rock formations. Too bad the weather meant it was harder to see anything in the distance. 

It wasn’t too long I got out of the track. The final downhill was quite steep and full of steps. Then it’s a nice road walk through small towns and bays, passing Mount Manaia on the way.

I took a small detour to a cafe just off the trail. I had a roast beef pie, fish and chips, and a mocha.

This seagull above me was being a nuisance. So I took its..... photo.

After that was a nice coastal walk to meet up with the gang. Although we found out later that Paul had already gone over with a different water taxi.

Peter and Norma took us over in their water taxi. They just live by the offical trail jetty. Norma came out and invited us to their home. We were kind of tired at that point, so all three of us just sat on their porch and watch Peter efficiently fillet a bucket full of fish, while their cat is lounging around waiting for a feed.

We went on to his nice boat and we slowly made our way over the river. Peter told us about the history of the place and of the oil refinery. It used to be a lot more polluting than it is now.

We walked to Ruakaka, through the Pipeline track, and resupplies at Fresh Choice. (I once again bought too much food). Then we had dinner beside it. I had pizza, they had kebabs.

Finally we got to Ruakaka Beach holiday park, where we found Paul. Susan and Sally are also there! Paul is going to meet up with a mate, and Lili is going to take a zero. So it looks like it’ll be Nicola, Susan, Sally and I for tomorrow. I’m gunning for Waipu Cove. Should be an easier day tomorrow, hopefully.
