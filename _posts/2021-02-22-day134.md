Brief synopsis of what went down after finishing the TA:

We went out to dinner and then had drinks back at the hostel, then drinks at the pub. Some stayed up really late. Celebrations and merriment all round. The day after we split up 😢. I managed to be up early enough to say goodbye to everyone (different people got up at different times). In the end, I’m the only one who did not stray from the Stewart island adventure. So I stayed another day at Invercargill to refuel and resupply.

World’s fastest Indian.

I changed accommodation to Southern Comfort BBH on others suggestion. It is SO much better. I recommend them to anyone. Turned out the other group were staying here another day. So I hung out with Maggie, Kieren, Joe, Caleb, Leon, Bruce, Paulie, Raul. They are a laugh. I found out Maggie’s trail name is “Shitmoo”, because she is shit at cow impersonations; Kieren’s is “Toevid-19”, pretty self explanatory. 

That night the group went out for more drinks. I didn’t go. I had to sort out my food and pack everything somehow. It’s Richmond Ranges all over again.

Maggie and Kieren expressed interest to come to Stewart island as well. But they were still asleep when the shuttle came (they were thinking of paying then). So I set off by myself. It’s been awhile since I did that. 

Some art I missed from when I walked to Bluff.

Once there I strolled to the town of Oban. There I found Ed at a picnic table. Kate was at the Foursquare and she joined us soon after. they were surprised to see me. I had known that they were on the island (Paulie told me) but I didn’t expect to bump into them. They did the Rakiura track chill and luxurious. They did hut to hut while hauling all sorts of nice food. It was great to see them. They suggested once everyone’s finished and back in Auckland we should do a JAFA TA reunion. Totally keen for that.

I went to the local DOC office to suss out the North West Circuit. A nice lady helped me with the itinerary and what I need to watch out for - mud, possible flooding, etc. 

Gas canisters hikers leave behind. Some people fly so you can’t bring them onboard.

I tried to call all the water taxi services around to see if they could take me to Port William Hut. I had done the Rakiura Great Walk before so I’ve already walked there from town. It would be nice to not have to walk it again. But every one was either full or not in service tomorrow. So walking it is. 

21.01km ~ 4:53

Oban to Bungaree Hut

Nice hot weather (for now).

I passed a _lot_ of people doing the Rakiura Track going to Port William Hut. I was going to sign the intentions book but there were no pens.

There was a couple who were also doing the North West Circuit. We were going to the same hut. Would be cool to have some company - Brad 🇦🇺 and Alice 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿. They brought fishing gear and a snorkel. Things most TA hikers would never think to bring. This allows them to eat off the land which is super cool.

The North West Circuit branches off the Great Walk. Right off the bat there is some mud. It wasn’t too bad though. It’s been pretty dry this past week so the mud has solidified somewhat. Not looking forward to what it’ll become after the downpour forecasted on Wednesday.

The beaches are quite stunning.

Bungaree Hut is right next to the beach and is really nice.

Hut book jokes, read at your own peril.

At this hut I met two ladies doing the same circuit in the other direction. It’s not SOBO or NOBO anymore, so I guess it’s COWI and ACOWI... Deb 🇺🇸 and Ellen 🇰🇷 are on day 8 and has done all the side trips and tomorrow will be their last day! Ellen said she saw an octopus swimming around the bay when she was fishing off the rocks. Oh and she has full dreads. So cool. 

Evening yoga by the sea.
