Waitomo to Te Kuiti

18.1km ~ 5:41

Pretty short day. Especially we took some sweet time waiting out rains. Also, I really wanted to visit the Hunts Farm Backpackers which is highly praised by past TA hikers.

There were notes about possible aggressive bulls shortly after Waitomo. Kind of glad (but slightly sad) I didn’t meet any.

You can pretty much always count on long morning grass to be wet. It hasn’t even started raining yet, which was forecasted to start around 8am.

Foxgloves are much preferable to gorse.

Trail notes mentioned the infamous “Te Kuiti Tunnel of Gorse” which has been cleaned up somewhat (depends on your definition of “up”). There are still heaps. Scott said “it’s no longer a tunnel; it’s a wall”. 

The first bush was a steep uphill and a steep downhill. It was all switchbacks though which helped.

Anyway the rained got heavy and Scott and Jane (the speedsters) rolled out their magical tarp and propped them up with their trekking poles. Water rolls off the magical tarp like children falling off surfboards.

We waited for the rain to ease for quite awhile. It was nice being dry. We also expected Wayne to come a lot sooner. He didn’t show up until much later. Turned out he got lost (won’t be the first time today).

We eventually headed off in slightly less heavy rain. I donned my double protection. Rain jacket and umbrella.

I lied. Umbrella is not recommended in New Zealand bush. In fact it’s a terrible idea.

We got out of the bush onto a field. I asked a noob question “how does hay work?” Scott and Jane then proceeded to explain it to me in great detail.

We walked on a neat little grassy ridge with nice views overlooking the surrounding farmland.

More heavy rain came and we hid under a well timed shed. Sorry Scott for cutting you in half with my terrible photography.

Scott and Jane have matching homemade pack covers with high-viz bling.

We went across a swing bridge. I really do look like a hobo hiding in the trees.

The track went into Pehitawa Forest, which  is “Queen Elizabeth II Trust-covenanted land and one of the finest remaining stands of Kahikatea trees”. It was really quite nice. Probably the highlight of today minus the food.

Going in stile!

When you go through so many paddocks, you’re bound to come across some well endowed ladies.

And well endowed helicopters.

There was a climb to some sort of mast on top of a hill on farmland. But instead of going there we just went to a cafe instead. It wasn’t a difficult decision.

Te Kuiti really likes statues.

Could have been “ANTEKUITI”.

I went to new world to resupply.

I called Emma from Hunts Farm Backpackers that I’m ready to be picked up (what excellent service!). She said “I’ll be right there”. And in 20 seconds (this was not an exaggeration) she was there in the car park waving at me. What timing!

Emma is super friendly. They host a lot of TA hikers and their place is absolutely wonderful. It has everything, including clothes for you to wear if you choose to do laundry for everything you own! This is my new favourite place.

Since this place has a fully kitted kitchen I bought some food from New World to cook here. And I cooked up a storm (I also set off the smoke alarm accidentally).

Life is good.

From this point on, I’m expecting even less cellular service. A couple of days (hopefully, but probably more likely three) to Pureora and then the Timber Trail. So I probably won’t be uploading any posts until Tauramunui. Jess don’t freak out!
