Zero day. 

St. Arnaud ➡️ Nelson

Had a healthy breakfast at the lodge. Kate and Ed joined me first. Then Steve, Bat and Torie came also.

We talked about plans of the day. Bat and Torie will push on since yesterday they took the shorter Red Hills track and got to St Arnaud at 9am. So they are pretty well rested. People also want to get over the Travers Saddle first before the forecasted heavy Thursday rain. Steve will go to Nelson with me getting a ride from a friend. 

Seeing off Bat and Torie. Good weather today! Great hiking to be had.

I strolled down to nearby Lake Rotoiti and visited the nice big DOC visitor centre to check out some routes.

At around midday Trevor rolled in on his ute. He introduced me to his girlfriend Corina who is from Sussex, UK. I met Trevor on the Whanganui River; first at John Coull Hut (day 52) and then at Joe’s place. He gave us a ride to his place near Nelson. He had started a backpackers in the past and his place reflects that.

His friendly dog Toon.

Trevor is also a dairy farmer. He had taken us through his farm of 700 cows. This was a view of his lands and his cattle.

We had wraps of salad and fish with some creamed mango for dessert.

After lunch Trevor took us to see some sights around Nelson. A memorial for Sir Rutherford, Pic’s peanut butter, and a place where _Bugger all Happened_.

We dropped Steve at Kathmandu so he could go and swap his pack with something that is better for him. 

Then we went to a pub. Trev drove down a back alley (at least it looked like one to me). And coincidentally I saw a familiar face. It was Alex! I last bumped into him at the Wellington train station just before Christmas. Here of all places I bumped into him again. He and another TA hiker - Linda, joined us at The Vic. Linda is a vet.

Alex and Linda are planning to do the Heaphy Track tomorrow. I’m a bit jealous.

I told Alex about my adventures in cold soaking. He wasn’t impressed. He cold soaks everything. I decided I need to use more chia seeds. 

My abode for the night. Cute.

For dinner we had roast potato and veges plus some goat that Trev hunted. There’s a chance he may take me hunting tomorrow 😲. Despite what Genny had told me goat was delicious.

We wound down in a spa with a view.

Later I got a call from Tahlia who is on the Queen Charlotte track. She wanted to know more about the Richmond ranges so I gave her the lowdown. It’s not as bad as you think. Just take care and have a level-headed head. You’ll be sweet.

Tomorrow: Resupply and 🤷🏻‍♂️
