Takapuna (I stayed at Devonport last night but left the trail from Takapuna) to Ambury Regional Park, Mangere

34km ~ 7:44 (about 4km ferry)

I had a great sleep at Tiffany’s. I would’ve loved to sleep in, but I got schedules to keep! Had toast and a coffee. Can’t go wrong with that. 

Archy lounged at the front door when we were about the leave. I’d like to think that he didn’t want me to go but that’s obviously not what was happening.

Iain offered to drive me to where I left the trail. I think he thought it was somewhere in Devonport, but I didn’t make it far yesterday so it was Takapuna beach. It will go through the single road that comes in and out of Devonport, and it was near rush hour so there was some congestion. Thanks for dropping me off! Probably the best trail angel I’ve stayed at so far. It’ll be difficult to top that.

Walking to Devonport ferry terminal was peaceful enough. The weather was great and as usual there were a lot of people out with their dogs.

In the distance was rain that was coming my way. It eventually reached me around Onehunga. But for now I’ve got great conditions.

Devonport town was quaint as always.

I went to visit the new office of my work for the first time. They moved there only after I left for the TA. The kitchen and basically everything else are super nice (sorry no photos; top trade secret stuff, ya know). Some of the team was away or on holiday but others were just keen enough to take a break from work to have some lunch. They are such workaholics. Especially Simon. It was great to catch up with these cool cats.

Flora even got me a care package full of nummy chocolates. Thanks so much! I already ate a bunch of them.

After the small detour to work I resumed the trail - going up to university of Auckland, my old stomping ground. There are many née buildings now. So much fancier than when I was there.

After that was Auckland Domain and Mount Eden.

The Auckland coast to coast track has its own signage as well. This is what they look like (with the white TA logo which was so small that’s not visible unless you are right underneath):

Then the trail went through One Tree Hill. I didn’t get a photo of the summit because that one tree hadn’t been there for a very long time.

Coming out of OTH I met the first pheasant that didn’t scream and immediately fly away as soon as it saw me.

Once I reached the southern coast the last part of the trail to Ambury Regional Park began. It meanders around Manukau Harbour to a peninsula.

Not again...

Pitched the tent in the rain!

Dinner with a fellow bipedal:

I told Lili where I was and she urged me to get out of the tent and look at the sunset. It did not disappoint.

A van came in to the campground later. It was a French couple, Luke and Lu, who came to NZ since March 2020 and has since been travelling due to you know what. Being French (Luke is from Burgundy and Lu is from another place whose name also starts with ‘B’), they offered me some wine. I drank said wine. Turns out they needed more wine since in two days they will fly back to France. So we all went to a liquor store nearby and we all bought for a little bit more. The lady at the store studied me for a bit too long; I was a tad disappointed she didn’t ask me for my ID. Deep down I know why. Sob.

Simon said I should make videos. Here it is. The sunset today. But I have a feeling he wanted to see me talking nonsense. I haven’t done that (yet).

Tomorrow I will try and get to the Auckland botanical gardens where Lili lives (nearby).
