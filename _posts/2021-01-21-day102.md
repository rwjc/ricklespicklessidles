A Frame Hut to Double Hut

Sleeping arrangements at the A Frame Hut last night: Ciara and Cath got cozy. Somehow they could stay in place the whole night.

Thanks A Frame Hut you are great.

The track to the incredibly rustic Comyns Hut was easy going.

But after that. Not. 

Someone commented that they did 54 river crossings. We probably didn‚Äôt do the same number but it‚Äôs probably close. They are not trivial crossings either. Also, the water was very very cold. I couldn‚Äôt feel my toes. 

At one point we got fed up and tried to go over instead of staying on the riverbed. It was a bad choice since we were forced to come back down and bush bash through some spikey bois (matagouri; which by the way are the worst. Even more so than gorse).

Team Wiggles. Glad to be alive.

The river crossing section was really slow going. We only did maybe 5km and it was already lunchtime. Also it started drizzling so out comes rain coats and the umbrella.

After some more river crossings via the tributaries which are smaller and less gnarly to cross we climbed the the Clent Hills Saddle.

There were a few scree slopes we had to sidle. It was fun though. Here are Malcolm and Ciara doing just that in their cute matching pack rain covers.

After the saddle, Cath and I started on one of these scree slopes. A few minutes in the sky opened. Suddenly there was snow and a vicious hail storm. The wind was unbelievably strong and the hail, which was fairly small individually, started hammering my face and my legs (I had shorts on). It hurt so much. 

There were nowhere to take shelter so we tried to go as fast as we could to the end of the scree and below a spur. There we quickly layered up and I wore my rain paints and gloves. It felt way better.

After that nonsense came short periods of rain and bright sunshine. This happened repeatedly all the way to the Double Hut.

There we met a hunter and her daughter, and TA SOBOs Charlie and Dave üá≥üáø, and Keith. The others from his group was in the next hut - Manuka Hut. We had decided earlier to not go there since it‚Äôs probably fully packed (it was). But it turned out we wouldn‚Äôt all get a bunk at Double Hut either.

The hut has 6 bunks. There was one left but I volunteered to sleep in my tent. Gotta practise pitching it every now and then.
