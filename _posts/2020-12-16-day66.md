title: Day 66&#58; Tararuas III. Small ascent and big descent then outta there
description: a windy night and a climb in the clouds. Then things opened up with great views on Mt Crawford. Right after a huge steep descent to the bottom valley and out to Otaki Forks.

Nichols Hut to Parawai Lodge

When we went to bed the air was calm as. But it didn’t last. Wind picked up throughout the night and it eventually made me unable to get back to sleep. It was loud and cold - how the Tararuas like it.

Brian was anxious about the weather so he climbed up to the ridge where there’s signal. He came back down to give us a briefing. It looks it’ll be fine today. 

The Tararuas NOBOs (Jane & Scott, Bill & Sarah) left early. We ended up leaving at 7am. Half and hour later than we wanted.

Initially it was foggy.

And then it wasn’t.

Sometimes it’s back.

Above the clouds. Breezy and refreshing.

1 hour from the hut to the top of Mt Crawford. Not bad!

And then over and down.

Back down into the bush.

So helpful.

At the bottom we walked along a river and got to Waitewaewae (YTYY) hut. We had a long lunch in this nice hut which has a nice swimming spot right in front of it.

Julia warned us about the track ahead which has a lot of “epic windfalls”. 

Here is an example:

![IMG_0694](/assets/images/20201216/img_0694.jpg)

There are so many that it’s very slow going. Many need some form of acrobatics just to get over/under/across. 

Rock hopping.

Not soon enough we went on an old tramway which I’m was infinitely better than the terrible track we just had. It was quite short though. Tahlia expressed her love of this part like so:

![IMG_0697](/assets/images/20201216/img_0697.jpg)

It was flat and wide and does not have vines and whatnot trying to slam into your face nonstop. 

Otaki Forks:

Just prior to a swing bridge to the campsite and lodge is a very nice swimming spot. The river was so beautiful. Charlotte and I took a dip and the water was very nice. Note that none of us had a shower for a week.

Parawai Lodge:

We had dinner. The fireplace is blazing. Life is good. Genny showed me how to cold soak my breakfast. “Put stuff in the jar and add water”.

Tomorrow: Waikanae
