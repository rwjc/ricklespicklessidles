Ngunguru to Ocean Beach camp

In the morning we had a nice and educational chat with Wendy (host of the Nikau Bay eco-camp with James). She told us about the work in conservation she does (often as a volunteer). She also has a background in software development and is trying to using a drone to detect a certain type of pine in the Bush. She also told us about trapping possums and stoats. It’s astounding how prolific they breed and how our own native animals do so in such a disadvantageous way. Wendy then went to work on a kayak with a conservation group in the morning. A nice way to go!

We set off. A short road walk ended near a place where we were attacked (with love) by corgis. James had warned us last night that this would happen. We were glad it did.

We soon got to the first river wading we needed to do today - Horahora River. The water was lovely and the level was at most knee high. At the end we were told there would be some black mucky mud and we definitely got that. It also has a smell that is pretty terrible.

Pataua is a nice little town that seems to getting some nice development along its river edges.

The second river we needed to get across was Taiharuru River. We got there at the trough of the low tide and the water was almost nonexistent. I’d preferred to have more water to be honest. More black mucky muck at the end which you can see Nicola was absolutely loving to walk through.

Paul being a gentleman and lowering the electric fence for Nicola to step over.

In another fence line after this Nicola actually tried to touch it. Since it didn’t look exactly to be electrified. First few times she tapped the line with the back of her hand and it was fine. As soon as she said “see it’s not electrified” and turned her hand over she got zapped. Best laugh of the day.

After crossing all the rivers we had a mountain to climb. It’s called Kauri Mountain. But it should be renamed to Gorse Mountain. It does have a very good view at the top though. It would have been fantastic if the weather was more permitting.

The last challenge of the day was Ocean Beach, which was a 7km beach walk. Nam flashbacks to the 90 Mile Beach. It somehow felt even worse. It was high tide and sand was soft. Also the waves pushed up something yellowy, grimey and slippery. Also we just wanted to get to camp. At the end we needed to go over a little hill using the high tide alternative route. It was short and actually gave us some nice views.

Noooooo Pingu! Doot doot!

Ocean Beach camp has nice camping areas, a nice shelter and a very nice hot shower (with soap!).

Tomorrow we will go over Bream Head (yay), and walk the Te Whara Track, get a water taxi across to Marsden Point, and do another beach walk to Ruakaka. That’s the plan anyway.
