Very short day today; springs in our steps as we move closer towards civilisation. Thank you for housing us Boyle Flat Hut (and all the huts before it).

It was Paul’s last TA section. When he reaches Boyle he would’ve completed (properly) all of Te Araroa. Well done!

We arrived at Boyle “Village”, which is an outdoor education centre camp. It has special treatment for TA walkers. There’s a shed to sell essentials at exorbitant prices. But if you are desperate for a soda it’s worth it.

Here I caught up with Jack, Steve, and Walter. The latter two had stayed here last night. All were going to hitch to Hanmer Springs for a break and a resupply. Ciara and I picked up our supply box which we sent before we started this section. 

Jack went off first. But luck has it that another TA walker - Ben 🇳🇿 (“Rustler” or “Turbo Ben”) were being driven to the trailhead “Windy Point” by his mum Sharon. His brother Sean was also there. They are on a holiday supporting Ben and also touring South Island. She happened to be staying at Hanmer Springs tonight. She also happened to drive her 7-seater car which we could just barely fit into with our packs. So lucky. Paul, Ciara, Walter, and I crammed in and went along to Windy Point to see Ben off. Hopefully I’ll catch up to him someday. 

You cannot see Paul because he is covered fully by his pack.

We got to Hanmer Springs. I’ve never been here and it looks really nice. Lots of restaurants and walkways. Of course there’s a hot spring place where you could soak in. 

Sharon dropped us off at the Kakapo Lodge and we booked our rooms. There we bumped into Ciara’s TA trail buddies in the Richmond Ranges - Chris 🇨🇦, Dani 🇨🇦, Kate 🇦🇺, and Catherine 🇮🇪.

We were all aching for some proper food so we went to Powerhouse which was suggested by Kate and Catherine. After ordering and devouring whatever it was that I had, I saw Bevan walk in the cafe along with his wife Jo. I recognised Bevan because he’s a prominent presenter in the Les Mills team and is heavily involved in the program (BODYATTACK) I was trained in. He also has a [podcast](https://www.bevanjameseyles.com/podcast?r_done=1) on fitness and health.

He invited me to join his table to chat more about what I was doing. It was fun talking to him about it. They had ordered a platter and had left quite a bit of it untouched. It was graciously given to us; Ciara and I devoured it quickly.

I tried to organise my resupply box. But I soon got distracted to go to the hot pools.

The hot pools were great. In addition to pools of different temperatures and ingredients, there are slides and tubes you could float down on. They can go quite fast and its really fun.

We all decided to go for Indian for dinner. Catherine left early to book us a table (and find an Indian place).

The food took a very long time to come. Our hiker hunger were grumbling and it was not going to end well unless we get what we wanted. Eventually the food came and it was great.

_Paul, Dani, Chris, Catherine, Kate, Ciara, me, and a random guy next table who decided to crash ours_

I ate so much I’m surprised that I’m still able to write this thing. 

Tomorrow: probably start back on trail.

_I think Guthook decided to update their trail km markers so the numbers no longer match up. I’m going to make today’s table the same as yesterday’s and then do a little adjustment for tomorrow_
