Glenrock Stream / Rakaia River to A Frame Hut

It was cold during the night. So cold that the mountains were covered in snow in the morning.

We went to have a coffee. On the way we bumped into Turbo Ben who we knew was lurking somewhere. We took a photo with the snow capped peaks and horses in the background.

“Unreal”

We had arranged with Methven Travels for a shuttle to get around the Rakaia River (it’s one of the hazard zones of the TA and they *do not* recommend you to ford it). We would’ve gone at 9am but the driver has somehow convinced us it’s not a good idea. So we decided to stay another day. The group going with Wayne from Alps 2 Ocean were still going to go at 12pm. We hung around the town, even went to check out the “Garden of Harmoney”, and got fed up. When we got back to the campground another driver from Methven Travels were there. We then convinced him to take us to the trailhead anyway. We couldn’t wait to get back on trail. 

The Rakaia - it’s a big one.

The trailhead. Finally on our way!

The trail is easy going, over a 4wd track. It was quite windy though.

We went over Turtons Saddle. There are switchbacks to the top. Tahlia you will love this.

The tussocks are lovely.

We found some snow beside the trail. Catherine and I made a (small) snowman in remembrance of Kate, who decided to desert us for no reason whatsoever. We hoped that Malcolm and Ciara would see it (or stomp on it, whichever is funnier).

We soon got to the A Frame Hut. It’s 3-bunks and is super cute. 

![IMG_3342](/assets/images/20210120/img_3342.jpg)

We waited for the others. Then we regrouped and discussed what to do next. We could easily go to the next hut, but that would mean we join the massive group in front of us (which would be cool), but it also mean that we will most certainly have to camp (not just tomorrow but many days after). It’s cold and windy so we decided to stay at this hut. We passed two other ladies on the way who would also stay here but we could make that work. 

Somehow I was in charge of chucking our socks onto the strut between the frame near the top. It was well done if I say so myself.

Cozy tent, cozy kitchen.

The two ladies came in soon. They are also TA hikers, doing sections. Debbie and Karuna. Both Kiwis.

While I was preparing my breakfast Debbie introduced a card game which was completely over my head. I still don’t know what’s happening.
