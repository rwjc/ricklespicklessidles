I hadn’t read much about today’s track yesterday. But the others have and I’ll just rely on them, as usual. But I do know that right away there is a fairly steep climb. And oh boy did we get that. 

Just before the climb to Pukeatua in the hot humid weather. The initial steepness wasn’t very long though. Then it was a fairly gentle climb to the top and then a moderate descent.

The forest was just a-okay. It’s hard to live up to the magnificence that we’ve been through the past few days.

After the forest, which we smashed through (maybe about 4 hours), is a road walk. I didn’t like road walks before. But I think I’ve changed my mind. You can just go so much faster on a road. 

We had lunch in a carpark at the end of the track. We met a DOC worker who was friendly and helpful. He offered us a ride into town when he’s finished. But we were heading off earlier. 

Later on the road he drove by and offered again. Genny went with him but the rest of us marched on. I was hoping to get to a nearby cafe.

The sign said open but the owner said it’s closed for months (due to COVID). So sad.

Now I just wanted to get into Waikanae. Luckily a farmer stopped and offered a lift. I immediately said yes and jumped on the back of his truck and waved Tahlia goodbye. 

I met Genny outside Countdown and we got some food for dinner tonight at the trail angels Andrew and Helen. 

Before then was a walkway alongside the river. The river looks really pretty. There are walkers, bikers, horse riders on the track. There are many easy accesses to the water and lots of families were having a great time by the river.

Andrew and Helen have a fabulous place and are absolutely friendly. We stayed at a sleep out that is the epitome of comfort. Especially after spending 7 days in the remote wilderness. 

Dinner was easy and so tasty (and healthy)!
