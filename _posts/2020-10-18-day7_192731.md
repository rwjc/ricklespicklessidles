First week on the TA! Seems so long ago now - my previous life. Time goes so fast (although not inside Raetea Forest. I’m sure time slows down twice as much in there).

This was going to be a shorter day, which was good because we all had incredible amounts of condensation in our tents at Makene Road campsite. Also it was super cold last night. It’s probably because there’s a stream right beside us.

We did our usual morning routines. Then we chatted until the sun came up. Then we put up our tents and quilts on the clothesline  they have set up. It’s brilliant.

This is a message Cindi wrote on the road for Mark to cheer him on. But Simon said he heard them drive off in the campervan at about 10pm last night he probably hasn’t seen it. But I’m glad they got off of that accursed forest.

We didn’t rush. Once everything is effectively dry we set off once again on the road one by one. This time my legs faired much better on the gravel. Am I getting stronger?

Then comes the saddest moment of all. There’s a dairy with ice cream, pies, hot food, and general merriment. But it was closed on weekends ☹️. We had known this but we were still absolutely shattered when we looked into the windows. I forgot to take a photo of the shit diary itself so you won’t need to feel the same despair as we did.

150km (by road) from Cape Reinga! Not long to go to Whangarei.

Then we entered the Omahuta Forest on a gravel road. I walked with Lili for awhile. She’s from Auckland too. We talked about the reason we’re doing the TA. There are many common themes. For a long time we talked about food. Then we had to stop because we didn’t want to get even hungrier. On the track we saw some nice big Kauri (great to see), an “airstrip” according to the Topo map, a “Giant Stump”.

At the end we reached the camp of the night. There is also a stream here. Hopefully we won’t get as bad of condensation as last night. There are lots of bird life here, especially grey warblers and their songs.

Tomorrow will be a long day with a very wet stretch walking down the middle of a stream. Should be interesting!
