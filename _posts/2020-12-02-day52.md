title: Day 52&#58; Row row row the boat, paddling down the thing
description: it’s a wonder how far you could go when you’re not hauling everything on your back, when the river floats you down faster than you could walk without doing anything. Whanganui FTW.

Whakahoro to John Coull Hut

38.07km ~ 4:51 (kayaking)

What a great morning for not walking 30km.

Last night the school children ran wild. They have yet to learn camping etiquette. Yelling, yapping, yammering at the top of their lungs. Ah being young. There’s nothing like it. Some even played what I assumed was  hide and seek and one hid behind my tent while I was lying in it. Kids will be kids I guess. At least their responsible adult made all of them go to sleep at 10pm. It’s passed our bedtime but at least it didn’t go even later. Thanks adult man!

Luckily for us in the morning they all packed up and left on their canoes. We were waiting for the cafe to open to get our last dose of barista coffee for 5 days. Mel from Blue Duck Cafe makes really good coffee. When she came and opened the door she told me that the power was out again! My jaw dropped but I realized quickly she was joking. She almost had me! So cheeky.

The eggs bennie was fabulous too!

After breakfast I asked Mel if I could use their phone. It was my dad’s birthday and I wanted to call him. She said the phone line is out. I don’t believe her anymore so she gave me the phone. I heard a tone but I wasn’t really sure if it was a dial done or not. It’s been awhile, also it didn’t sound like anything I was familiar with. Anyway Mel gave me the password to their staff wifi which was super kind of her. I wished my dad happy birthday. Happy birthday dad!

Ben from Taumarunui Canoe Hire drove in with our vessels and some other journeymen and we headed to the launching beach. He gave the TA people some of Karen’s lovely homemade buttered bread and chocolate muffins. Brian had spoiled it for me already so I kind of knew it was coming. It was still great though. Such a nice thing for them to do.

Ben gave us all barrels to put our packs and other stuff in. He also delivered us the barrel of food and drinks we stuffed in back in Taumarunui. Lastly he gave us all a final review of how to handle the kayak or canoe. There were no other solo hikers there so I ended up with a kayak. Gotta power myself the whole way. No biggie (famous last words).

We launched into Rutaruke River and for about 500m of calm waters we could get into the groove on our canoes/kayaks. Then the river joins Whanganui River and our official journey began.

The water level is high and brown. Just like yesterday. The weather was great though. Sunny and not windy. Perfect. 

Goats on the top of bluffs kindly seeing us off.

Vlastimil shared his beers with us (since his barrel happened to be easily reachable). It felt great! Drink and paddle. Nothing ever goes wrong.

We had lunch at a campsite on route. It also happened to be where all the other school kids were having lunch as well. 

Looking at the map to make sure we were not lost.

Their ladened canoe and my agile kayak.

The 37km to John Coull Hut went by really quickly. And we weren’t even paddling all that much. Time to eat like kings and queens with all the things we brought in our barrels.

The biggest physically challenge of the day was hauling all the barrels up to the campsite.

A warden was at the hut. Rene came and made sure we were supposed to be there. She took longer with me because I had changed my booking and she is on 8-day shifts so her printed spreadsheets didn’t have me on this day. The hut is pretty fancy.

More and more people arrived in the afternoon. Luckily the school kids weren’t staying here tonight. 

I met Trevor and Collin who were from Nelson and Tauranga, respectively. They are good friends and they are incredibly witty and funny. We had lots of good laughs.

Later at dinner I met others at the shelter near our campsite. Pip and Maia are a mom and daughter duo who have been walking all over NZ previously (sometimes also the lengths of the country on different paths) and is now doing the TA. They started in September and have a very relaxed way about them that are so welcoming. There was also Maggie and Levon who are environmental researchers from the US, currently working in Milford Sound! They had a choice before to work in Westport but I think they made a great decision. 

We talked about all the favourite places in NZ we’ve visited. I have been around the least out of all of them! I had a fun time talking about the different sections of TA with Pip and Maia. We ended up showing each other videos of beautiful weather on top of summits after finding out that the other were up there with crappy weather. It oddly became a friendly competition to one-up each other to show how beautiful it actually was. It was hilarious. 

Tiers of tents.
