10:05km ~ 2:11

Caseys Hut to Mavora Campsites

Then hitched to Te Anau.

We were considering how far to go today before trying to hitch. Depending on how many cars are at the campsite which are accessible by the road, we may continue on the trail or just hitch to Te Anau. 

It was cold and windy, and the last section hasn‚Äôt been the greatest for our morale. We were pretty miserable (more or less).

It was easy going beside the Movora lake. We were flying. Partly it was because we really wanted to get into town.

At the campsite Catherine managed to secure us a hitch to the state highway. There are two guys who were doing a walk by the lake. We just need to wait a bit for them to return. 

Alex tried on others packs. His is by far the lightest.

We had to walk a bit to find where the guys giving us a hitch parked their cars. This campsite is massive.

The outlet river is very green.

About to go.

We were dropped off at the junction to the state highway. So we prepared for another hitch to Te Anau. It was even windier and colder here. This is how we attempted it.

Ben told me I looked like Bananas in Pyjamas. I could not disagree with him.

Nice cafe food yay.

Met up with Charlotte, Ciara at the YHA. Charlotte is feeling better which is good. She tried to style my hair. Not sure what happened.

I was hoping to meet up with Bat üá´üá∑ who works at the YHA. And Lo and behold he was at the reception when I walked in. I first met him at Red Hills Hut in the Richmond Ranges. He‚Äôs totally cool.

We went to a food truck for dinner. Waiting for the food. It‚Äôs not a flattering photo.

Bao and loaded fries.

Sun is going down. 

![IMG_4702](/assets/images/20210211/img_4702.jpg)

I went for a walk along Lake Te Anau.

Goodnight. 

Tomorrow: probably a rest day (another one I know I‚Äôve gotten so lazy)
