Morena. Got a nice brisk chilly morning. 

Last night Charlotte and I had a bit of an impromptu boxing match. We agreed to hit each other to stop any snoring from the other person. We don‚Äôt really snore that much but sometimes there‚Äôs a bit of a wizz. So we did end up exchanging blows. But she started hitting me (when she had her eyes closed) even when I was awake. So there was some retaliation and a bit of a kerfuffle. What was interesting though was that she didn‚Äôt remember that happened this morning. ü§î

Time to tackle the aptly named ‚ÄúBig Hill‚Äù. Kiwis have a way of naming things that describe them perfectly. But before that we had to get across Roses Saddle. There weren‚Äôt any roses on it though.

At the bottom we were given a choice. High route or the low route. We picked the low route which goes through a river. It‚Äôs nice to be walking through a river again.

We reached Macetown which was a derelict town with remnants of buildings that had Chinese gold miners settling here many years ago. It has some nice looking campsites too.

Big Hill Track. It was really hot but some occasional breeze made it more bearable.

It‚Äôs a cute town.

We had dinner / second lunch at Slow Cuts. Highly recommended.
