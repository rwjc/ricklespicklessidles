Rest day again in Christchurch. 

Lazy day for me. I slept quite late night. Then I got up at 8:30. It was so late I shocked myself.

We went for breakfast. I bumped into Alex who came in the night before. He just finished the Richmonds and somehow managed to hitch all the way to Christchurch. Impressive. 

At C1 there was a rocking horse at the place and, Ciara, being horse mad, rushed to ride it.

I’ve been using forks all wrong.

I had a burger for lunch. No photos though. 

After lunch it was dinner, at Little High.

Ciara met up with her friend Tom who is very outdoorsy. 

Back at the backpackers more hikers showed up escaping the  bad weather. Walter, Steve, Paul from Tokoroa. It was movie night - A Walk In the Woods. How topical.

Tomorrow: Maybe Methven. Might need to skip the Cragieburn forests for now and come back and do it later.
