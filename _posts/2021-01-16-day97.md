16.02km ~ 3:50

Goat Hut to Bealey Hotel, then hitched to Arthur's Pass Village

- Mingha Track

Goat Pass Hut is just below the pass itself. So it was quick to go over and start the decent into the valley on the other side. Clouds have rolled in as well, although it didn’t go down further and the sky cleared up quickly.

On the southern side of the pass is Mingha River. The track on this side is similar to the day before coming up Deception River. But it’s a lot easier and with less river crossings. There are even lots of boardwalks regularly on the track. 

Morning glow.

Mingha Bivvy on the way. We didn’t even go in. Chris and I were having too much fun trying to up the pace going down. Sometimes almost running it. Chris told me the key is to not hesitate and keep the flow when stepping. It’s pretty great and I can see why people like trail running. Running uphill is a whole different matter though.

Further downstream we’re back to rocky river beds and later when we started the “Klondyke Track” (it’s not really a track) it went through some grassy and often prickly fields.

At some points there were these blocky concrete constructions that looked like things I see in war movies.

We arrived at the Bealey Hotel and both of us ordered a burger. It tasted really good. No more instant mash potatoes (for now).

I messaged Bill, the owner of The Sanctuary in Arthur’s Pass Village. He is well known in TA circles since he’s really good to us. During COVID lockdowns he let hikers stay here who have no where to go (foreigners) so they could form their bubble. I booked a “concrete tent” and he graciously offered to pick me up at the hotel in 10 minutes. I quickly packed up and waited by the road. He normally stays in Christchurch and usually comes in 1 day a week to keep things running smoothly. Today was that day. Easiest hitch ever. 

The “concrete tent” with a big glass window which has views of the mountains.

Chris and Dani (Turbo Ben nicknamed them in the intention book “Chrani”) are here already. They had come out at the footbridge just before going into the Deception Valley Route. Paulie 🇮🇪 was also here. They had all stayed here for a zero day and went to to the Avalanche Peak track. It was such a nice day to do it too. If I had another day and the weather is good (weather is going to turn really bad starting tomorrow 😢).

I got my washing started and went into the nearby store where a kea happened to be at the front flipping cups over the table.

We had a brief chat with an eccentric local Wayne. After that surprisingly (but happily) Ciara, Kate, and Catherine popped up by the door! They had camped just before going into the Deception route and did that, Goat Pass, and the Mingha in one day. It was great to see them again so soon. 

We went to the Wobbly Kea for dinner. Their kids menu is cute.

It was the first time for me on trail where there were more Irish hikers than other nationalities. 

There were lots of gossip to be shared. But what happens on the trail... stays on the trail. 

Kate 🇦🇺 has finished the South Island TA. She started as a NOBO but flipped when she reached Arthur’s Pass and went SOBO from Ship Cove. Now she’s done!

Chrani have also finished their section. So there will be some tears tomorrow I’m sure. 

Malcom shared some of his photos with me. They are really good!

Tomorrow: probably continue on in the terrible weather which will last many days and it looks like it’ll be super wet.
