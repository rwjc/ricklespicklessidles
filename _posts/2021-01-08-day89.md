As forecasted by Paul and Ciara, we got a bit of blue sky in the morning.

First order of business in the morning is Travers Saddle. A rocky climb to start. It‚Äôs pretty straightforward. Not much drama there.

Mount Travers.

Ciara leading the way down. (We didn‚Äôt need to go across that scree slope. Just down the obscured path to the side).

A wild woman appears.

I found out Ciara has done the John Muir Trail and she has been spoilt by it. Also her trail name is _Trail Turkey_.

Massive waterfall in the distance covered by trees.

West Sabine Hut. We had a break there. Ciara wants to catch up to her mates Kate and Cath and I want to catch up to Genny and others I met at St. Arnaud but they are way ahead of me. Kate and Cath are closer so Ciara was pretty keen to do a big day today and go over Waiau Pass as well. We shall see.

A cool wooden chess board at the hut.

Weather forecast. We are all really keen to check this every time it‚Äôs updated (by radio). 

![IMG_2435](/assets/images/20210108/img_2435.jpg)

Swing!

These Nelson Lakes river waters are refreshing in the water bottle,

![IMG_2441](/assets/images/20210108/img_2441.jpg)

and also in your boots. 

![IMG_2449](/assets/images/20210108/img_2449.jpg)

There‚Äôs a cave you could use for shelter if you really wanted to. 

![IMG_2451](/assets/images/20210108/img_2451.jpg)

Ciara and her sticky. 

![IMG_2458](/assets/images/20210108/img_2458.jpg)

What a magical place. 

![IMG_2461](/assets/images/20210108/img_2461.jpg)

We got to Blue Lake Hut at about 2:30pm. It‚Äôs a nice hut. Fires‚Äô already on. We decided to not do the Waiau Pass today which would probably mean getting into camp quite late. We prefer comfort. 

![IMG_2467](/assets/images/20210108/img_2467.jpg)

![IMG_2468](/assets/images/20210108/img_2468.jpg)

![IMG_2482](/assets/images/20210108/img_2482.jpg)

Close by it is Blue Lake (Rotomairewhenua) - not to be confused by the one on Tongariro. A lady at the hut is familiar with all the Maori names of all the natural features around here and it is very cool to hear them pronounced properly.

It‚Äôs a very nice lake. Quite a decent size and very blue in the deeper parts. Well worth the hike.

Lots of people are at the hut. Nelson lakes huts have all been really busy (the most busy on the TA so far). There are even two hut wardens here. 

In addition to Paul whom I met yesterday at Upper Travers, Paul _from Tokoroa_ also rocked up. I haven‚Äôt seen him since Puhoi and I thought he was ahead of me. He had a bit of bad tummy issue in Wellington and had a few days off. He still looks exactly as I remembered. 

Tomorrow: Waiau Hut
