description: a side trip where we did the Routeburn in one day. It rained most of the way. Not much views. At least I can say I‚Äôve done the Routeburn.

Morena! It‚Äôs overcast and we knew the forecast. Rain is coming.

Catherine came up with the team name. ü¶Ä CRAB: Catherine, Rick, Alex, Ben. Luckily Ben was with us and not Paulie. 

The others will do the usual TA route and enter the Greenstone via Kinloch. 

Since we are cheap-ass TA hobos we weren‚Äôt going to pay the exorbitant fees of Great Walk huts/campsites. They are probably fully booked anyway. Alex and I had planned to go freedom camp in the Valley of the Trolls, which is off track from the Routeburn. But because of the weather (heavy rain and gale force winds at Harris Saddle overnight) we had to abandon that idea. The only option left is to do the Routeburn in one go and stay at a non-Great Walk hut/campground. 

We got a shuttle that came at 9am. Ideally it would be earlier but we make do. Before the pick up I went back to Vudu cafe and got a coffee and some takeaway food for lunch. 

An hour and something later we arrived at the Routeburn trailhead at the east side.

Prior to Harris Saddle (which was about 1275m and pretty easy) it was misty but generally dry.

Routeburn Falls Hut. These Great Walk huts are ginormous. The best things about them are flush toilets that come with TP. Seriously.

The falls 1min behind the hut is nice. There are also some really good swimming holes. You could do a day trip here and have a good swim if the weather is good.

Heading towards Harris Saddle.

Lake Harris.

As expected of a Great Walk, there are lots of people on the track. My sister told me to look for her friends. ‚ÄúFind two blond girls‚Äù she said. Thanks sis that helps a lot. They were the ones who spotted me it turned out. I passed them just before the saddle. My sister gave them more of my features to look for. Good timing to meet at a fairly scenic spot.

We spent some time at the shelter at Harris Saddle. It‚Äôs actually better than many rustic huts I‚Äôve come across. You‚Äôre not supposed to stay there though, unless it‚Äôs an emergency. 

The rain also started as we started descending on the other side. My photos took a drop in quality and also I wasn‚Äôt as trigger happy. 

Lake Mackenzie and Mackenzie Hut. Again, it‚Äôs massive.

Earland Falls.

We got to where Lake Howden Hut used to be. It was destroyed a couple of years ago by the major weather event.

We were in the forest going alongside Lake McKellar to the hut. We were pretty drained at this point. I got a bad case of chafing - inner thighs and my lower back. Turbo Beamer actually goes faster and faster as he gets near a hut. It‚Äôs a nice power to have.

The Routeburn is in Mt Aspiring National Park. But now somehow we are in Fiordland National Park.

It was great to finally arrive at McKellar Hut. A fire was already burning. The hut is about half full. I met a guy who did the TA in 2016 (I think). It‚Äôs probably the best hut I‚Äôve been on this whole trail (although technically it‚Äôs not on the TA). It‚Äôs got flushing toilets and TP, two separate rooms for bunks with different arrangements - individual ones and big flat bunks, a big lounge and kitchen with a fireplace, and you can stay here using a backcountry hut pass.

Late dinner and late sleep. We might need a sleep in and a short day tomorrow. I hope the weather improves.
