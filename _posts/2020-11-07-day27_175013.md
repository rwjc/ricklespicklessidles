Stillwater to Mairangi Bay

19.08km ~ 6:34

To follow the trail and get to Long Bay by fording the Okura River, we needed low tide (as always). Low tide today was 6:23 am. This meant we had to get up really early. The first night on trail where I got sub-8 hour sleep.

The walk through the estuary was beautiful. The morning was calm and peaceful.

When we got near the deeper part of the river where we needed more care, I saw a man going over with his pack raised overhead. The water was up to his chest. Then I heard a loud curse. Turned out he left his water bottle on this side of the river. So he forded back again!

At this point we introduced ourselves. His name is *Vlastimil* and he is from Czechoslovakia. He helped us carrying Jess’ day pack over. Now one interesting thing you may not know about my sister is that she has not enjoyed a growth spurt many others have had when they were young, to be somewhat blunt. At the deepest the water came up to her neck! Luckily for us the water was gentle and warm.

I realized later that we didn’t follow the route as described by the TA app precisely. We were slightly upstream. Maybe that’s why it was so deep.

After drying and cleaning ourselves at the end we started the walk down the bays of Auckland’s North Shore.

We stayed for breaks in many bays and had a long lunch in Browns Bay at Commons cafe. It was great!

Once we got to Mairangi Bay we got a ride to Jess’ home. We both had a nap to catch up on some sleep. My parents came around later and had some Chinese takeaways for dinner. Thanks for hosting me Jess and Jake!

Tomorrow I’m planning another small day to Devonport. Hopefully I’ll meet up with some friends along the way!
