ü•ù Kiwi Hut to üêê Goat Pass Hut

- Deception Valley Route

I heard a kiwi early in the morning. It was right outside the hut, coincidentally called Kiwi Hut. Clouds have come in over night. Chris promised it‚Äôll clear up later.

The trail took us through two unnamed private huts / shacks.

There were lots of big river crossings on the Taramakau. Sometimes the current can be quite strong. A few times it was ‚Äúballs deep‚Äù according to Chris.

Sometimes there was an obstacle course. 

![IMG_3052](/assets/images/20210115/img_3052.jpg)

I‚Äôm smiling but inside I‚Äôm not enjoying walking on the rocks for so long. 

![IMG_3055](/assets/images/20210115/img_3055.jpg)

A walk in the bush is a good break from the river. 

![IMG_3061](/assets/images/20210115/img_3061.jpg)

There were lots of horopito plants growing as we walked towards the Morrison footbridge. 

![IMG_3062](/assets/images/20210115/img_3062.jpg)

It‚Äôs not going to take 8 bloody hours. 

![IMG_3063](/assets/images/20210115/img_3063.jpg)

Never in doubt, except every other day. 

![IMG_3064](/assets/images/20210115/img_3064.jpg)

Chris was right! It cleared up as we started towards the Deception Valley. To be fair Alesha did give us the forecast yesterday.

![IMG_3067](/assets/images/20210115/img_3067.jpg)

Lunch by the Deception River. We started seeing trail runners coming through. They were all training for the Kathmandu World Coast to Coast Multisport race. They look so fit. One lady who came through was actually a friend of Chris‚Äôs. 

![IMG_3069](/assets/images/20210115/img_3069.jpg)

There‚Äôs basically no track. It‚Äôs a poled (sometimes) route. 

Rocks.

![IMG_3075](/assets/images/20210115/img_3075.jpg)

More rocks. 

![IMG_3078](/assets/images/20210115/img_3078.jpg)

Waterfall. 

![IMG_3082](/assets/images/20210115/img_3082.jpg)

Even more rocks. 

![IMG_3090](/assets/images/20210115/img_3090.jpg)

![IMG_3096](/assets/images/20210115/img_3096.jpg)

Upper Deception Hut. A bit lacking. We met a trapper here. He had a great pounamu necklace. We had originally planned to stay here. But it didn‚Äôt look that great and we had time and it‚Äôs not far from the next hut. So we pushed on. 

![IMG_3098](/assets/images/20210115/img_3098.jpg)

That meant more rock hopping. Rocks turned into boulders and it was simultaneously fun and exhausting. 

![IMG_3101](/assets/images/20210115/img_3101.jpg)

Looking back. Nice valley. Nice swimming hole. 

![IMG_3108](/assets/images/20210115/img_3108.jpg)

There was a decent waterfall where we crossed a few times just before it. 

![IMG_3111](/assets/images/20210115/img_3111.jpg)

![IMG_3112](/assets/images/20210115/img_3112.jpg)

It was hot and we decided to go for a wee swim in a great pool not too far from Goat Hut. 

![IMG_3113](/assets/images/20210115/img_3113.jpg)

Team Cold Pools. 

![IMG_3116](/assets/images/20210115/img_3116.jpg)

Not bad. 

![IMG_3119](/assets/images/20210115/img_3119.jpg)

Goat Pass Hut. It‚Äôs really good. Spacious and has a great view. No fireplace though. Best thing: no sandflies. 

![IMG_3121](/assets/images/20210115/img_3121.jpg)

![IMG_3122](/assets/images/20210115/img_3122.jpg)

For dinner I‚Äôve been doing this for awhile now and I‚Äôm a fan. I got these Radix meals back when I did the Richmond Ranges. I have since eaten their contents but I kept the packets. I now put my meals in them and add boiling water. Mash potato and instant noodles with all sorts of dehydrated stuff (mushrooms, gojiberries, curry powder, peas, mixed veges, etc. I could then cook both at the same time, which I would not be able to to if I cooked them in the pot. This way I don‚Äôt need to wash the pot as well! Sometimes I have ideas. I‚Äôve actually sent my homemade pot cozy back home since I‚Äôve been doing this switcheroo boogaloo. No regrets.

![IMG_3125](/assets/images/20210115/img_3125.jpg)

Also, just for laughs, here‚Äôs my cold soak breakfast. 

![IMG_3127](/assets/images/20210115/img_3127.jpg)

![IMG_3128](/assets/images/20210115/img_3128.jpg)

Blueberry slices, boysenberries, oats (coconut flavoured), sunshine mix, milk powder / yoghurt powder, LSA, and water of course. I need to add chia seeds. 

The views from this hut is so good.

Song the way we passed a father & son duo. Ross and Harry. Ross is 75 and is a champ. He‚Äôs done lots of things over the world. One time he was working on some system in the Congos but he couldn‚Äôt remember the details. They came to Goat Pass Hut as well.  

Tomorrow: Arthur‚Äôs Pass.
