Dome Valley to Puhoi

27.59km ~ 6:46

Last night Paul and Nicola arrived after a long day hike. They did both Tamahunga and Dome Forest in a single day. Great job!

This morning Nicola and I took off first. The track to Puhoi shouldn’t be too bad. One small hill and that’s about it. 

Came through a small section where the grass looked a bit trippy.

A scenic reserve and some road walks to start with.

Came across a fluffball of a chicken farting back and forth across the road. Why does a chicken walk across the road?

Then we climbed Moir Hill on a 4wd track.

On the way down it turned into a bush track and then a farm track.

On Remiger Road there was a newish campsite that DOC has set up. It had everything you’d need. Nice camping area, toilet, shelter with tables, and water. It’s not on Guthook or the TA app. But it’s really good, wish I had known about it earlier.

Just before getting to town was the Puhoi track. It’s pretty well maintained but it seemed to go on a bit too long since I really wanted to get to Puhoi.

I got to the general store. I ordered a coffee plus oysters and chips. It was expensive for the amount of food but it tasted good.

We then went to Puhoi Pub which has a lot of charm. The locals have their own flavour as well. I had Texan buffalo hot sauce wings. They were HOT.

Paul is leaving the trail temporarily to go to a concert in Tauranga. I’m sure we’ll meet up again before too soon.

Tonight we’re staying at trail angel Pip’s (Phillippa) place. She has a wonderful home full of animals. Her kids are great too!

Her two dogs - Odin and Pippin are very friendly. Sometimes too friendly.

They have a backpackers room with 2 beds but they are occupied so we pitched our tents. She has a really nice lawn and garden.

The power happened to go out so I ended up having a hot shower in the dark. But it was back on when it was Nicolas turn. 

Pippin can be well behaved when he’s not jumping around like a rocket.

Phillipa even invited me to have dinner with them. It was so tasty.

She grew an avocado tree from seed and the fruits are few but tiny and cute. She said she just squeeze them out onto toast.

Oh today we passed the 500km mark! Whoop!

Tomorrow we’re going to try and kayak down Puhoi river to Wenderholm, weather permitting. Then carry on to Red Beach!
