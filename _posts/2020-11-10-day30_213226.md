It rained throughout the night. In the morning it was still going, so I made breakfast and packed up everything from inside the tent. I hear the French couple drive off early. They were going to sell the van before they leave for home tomorrow.

The first part of the day was the Watercare coastal walkway. It was peaceful and there were colonies of birds along the coast.

There was an unexpected closure and a detour which added a few Ks early in the day.

I passed through some long grasses combed over by rain and groves of cabbage trees.

There’s a public avocado orchard that anyone can come to pick fruit. But due to the roadblocks in Ihumatao (see below) you will need to walk to it. Also, I was told that people are usually too impatient and come in to knock the fruits down when they are still growing. So it’s probably not a good place to get your avocados. Better to spend your home deposit somewhere else.

Out of this orchard is Ihumatao and the protection zone that the locals have set up. It was in the news some time ago. I didn’t realize I would be passing through it. It felt surreal. One local I met was really friendly though.

The road to the airport was uninteresting. But there was a shared path that is far from the busy highway. Unsurprisingly the turnoffs to the international terminal was much quieter than the domestic terminal.

Why must you bad weather always linger where I’m headed??

This is how cool kids spell it these days:

Ironically for the people in the office their view is messed up by the message.

I really enjoyed the Puhinui Resrve and the stream walk. The water current was strong.

When I got to the Auckland Botanic Gardens the rain started pouring again.

This is an ideal camp for old youths like me:

The gardens is connected by Totara Park. After climbing a small hill I popped out to a street where Lili and Hugo lives. They welcomed me in and we had Sichuan/Chengdu style hot pot. It was hot and numb and more.

Not sure how the stomach and its orifice will feel tomorrow but it was totally worth it.

Their dog Rudi likes to get close to you but give you the stink eye when you try to pet it. At least for me that is. 

Tomorrow Hugo will take Lili to Mercer. I have decided to cheat again and tag along. Otherwise I’d be doing a full road section through South South Auckland past the Bombay Hills. A long time ago the trail would have gone east and enter the Hunua Ranges, which I’ve done before. But it’s not possible anymore due to closed tracks. I’m not bothered by skipping this road detour.
