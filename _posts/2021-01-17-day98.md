Rest day. Because the weather forecast is terrible. And we didn‚Äôt want to stay in Arthur‚Äôs Pass and be miserable.

Ciara by coincidence found a guy with a private bus who is going to Christchurch and is keen to give us a ride. So good!

Keith has repurposed the inside of the bus to make it more of an apartment and he has been living in it for a long time.

It‚Äôs a massive bus and he is also towing his car behind it.

He dropped us off at the outskirts of Christchurch where we could take a bus in. We traded and ate snacks and two friendly locals told us the fare so we could get the right change for the driver.

We checked in at the YHA and went to the Riverside Market for lunch. I had Vietnamese.

Found more Irish / Ireland enthusiasts around town. They are everywhere now.

Didn‚Äôt take long to end up having a drink at an Irish pub.

Dani and Chris got the great idea of making tacos so we chipped in some beers and dessert and we made it at the backpackers. It was awesome. Oh and we met a hiker Nathaniel üá∫üá∏ who has done the South Island TA in 2017 and is now doing his own routes.

Kate and Ciara‚Äôs antics.

Later we went to play pool and then went to a few more places for drinks. But I got really tired so I left a bit early.
