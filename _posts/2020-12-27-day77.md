Last night before bed (but after I wrote yesterday’s post) I hung out in the dining room chatting with a couple - Alex 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 and Tellisa 🇸🇪 (sorry if I mispelt) as well as another TA hiker who rolled in after the thunderstorm - Ciara 🇮🇪. Charlotte had told me a lot about her since they’ve hiked together for a long time. Ciara is her _mentor_. She is super fun.

In the morning I had a schedule. Helen from The Link Bus came to fetch me at 7:30 to take me to Picton. She’s bought the business from its original owners 3 years ago. There used to be a lot of TA business in the past two years. 

I went back to Picton to pick up my resupply which I stored in a locker at Atlantis Backpackers. Genny was going to get a lift to Pelorus Bridge and I thought she would’ve gone by the time I got there. But I saw her pack at the reception. When she showed up I asked if I could tag along. Darcy who helps out Sheira at the backpackers was driving her and Alexis. Luckily there was one seat left in the van. 

We dropped Alexis off at the Queen Charlotte track entrance at Anikiwa. She is NOBO so she will start there. It’s the last section for her!

It looked so different to yesterday when I got out. When we started driving a hiker stuck out his thumb. He is Brad, a section hiker and is also going to do the Richmond Ranges but we took him to Havelock so he could resupply.

Darcy drove us to Pelorus Bridge. He offered to take us even further to the start of the trail. Genny went with him but I got out here since... there’s a cafe.

After this I tried to pack my 9/10 day worth of food into my pack. They almost don’t fit. It’s really heavy.

Pelorus River.

The final road in.

There’s still quite a bit of road walking to the trailhead. I tried hitching. It took awhile. But eventually got one. Guy is super chill. He’s got a bit of land down this way that he regularly works on. He took me to his driveway which is only about 3.6km left to the track. I started walking and soon I saw a familiar pack. 

It was Vlastoff “the ukulele guy” Vlastimil himself. Last time I was with him was in Whanganui. After the river journey. Wayne we miss you!

Soon we were in the forest.

This is the start of endless huts, swing bridges, and sandflies. On the way we passed Emily, who is doing TA on the South Island only. We also passed another group of 4 who are I think section hikers - Laura, Brett, Sophia, and ***** (damn you brain why fail me now). Sophia recognised me from some posts on the TA trail angels FB group. She knew / had hosted Tahlia before and I was in her halfway post.

Cooling off in the middle of a steep climb.

After the strenuous climb we got to Rocks Hut. It has flush toilets.

There are lots of people here. Even the north shore tramping club in Auckland are doing tramps here. There’s also a guy Ben who has done the TA back in 2016. He loved it. A solo Australian girl Darcy was also there. She’s a section hiker on holiday. She works in a vineyard which is the “biggest vineyard you’ve never heard of”. I’ve never heard of it. 

Genny was here already. Chilling out. 

Vlastimil and I were the last in. We cooked and ate after everyone already finished. 

There aren’t enough bunks but there were extra mattresses. The view from mine:

Not too shabby. 

Tomorrow Vlastimil wants to do some unworldly miles / kilometres (in this terrain). I don’t know if I can keep up but I will try a little.
