I had pancakes for breakfast. Not sure why but I usually prefer savoury things in the morning. I felt like something sweet until I ate half of it. Then it became more of a chore. The coffee was good though. Vudu Cafe.

Had a nice walk around the lake with Jess and Jake.

Then we met up with Catherine and Charlotte for some more Ferg Bakery. 

Ciara invited us to her friend’s barge. It was handmade and it’s pretty impressive.

Then we had second dinner with the others. Briefly met Bruce who is also doing the TA.

Kate and Ed did the Arrowtown-Queenstown section today on a bike. I might do the same tomorrow. It’s supposed to be chill and about 3 hours. Turbo Ben ran it. 

Alex also came into Queenstown today over Big Hill. He finally caught up to me. We went out for dinner. 

Tomorrow: Bike to Arrowtown and back to Queenstown somehow.
