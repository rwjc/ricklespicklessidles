Rangiriri to The Hakarimata Ranges

30.69km ~ 7:33

Woke up, packed up, breakfast up (little cafe beside the pie shop), and then on our way.

Water and marsh - two faces of the Waikato river. Luckily we didn‚Äôt go anywhere near wetlands today.

Grassy stopbanks for 10km. This time with Lili, Scott, and Jane.

Scott and Jane had done their fair share of long distance bike touring in Europe and Asia. Now that their kids have all grown up it was the right time to put everything on hold and start the TA. (Tiffany that‚Äôll be you in a couple of years!). Another thing I learnt was that Jane really likes oysters.

We came across a golf course. It was the nicest grass I‚Äôve walked on.

Near the end of the stopbanks on the trail Scott‚Äôs friend John drove by to meet him. He brought him a big bottle of juice and some cream buns. He gave Lili and I one to share! Thanks John!

Lili and I continued while they catch-up.  We passed the power station, an interesting house, a dairy where I got a pie and a Cornetto. West Huntly is a bit rough to be honest. Soon we cross the bridge to the other side of Huntly where there is food and a Countdown.

I went to a Chinese place and had a beef noodle soup and some black sesame tong yuan. In Subway next door we met a new hiker Terry, who was continuing his thruhike which stopped abruptly last season at Rangiriri. So today was his first day on the trail! He will stay in Huntly tonight.

We regrouped after a small resupply at the supermarket and set off. We had decided to skip Huntly and dry camp in a grass clearing a short distance into the Hakarimata ranges. People have commented and confirmed it on Guthook and it will make today a more reasonable day.

The walkway up is 1500 stairs and Cathy (Rangiriri Pies) told us when the All Blacks are nearby they would sometimes come train on these steps. 

Going up was fast (but hot). One of the lookouts was amazing. The Waikato river and Huntly in full view.

We tried a group photo. Lili didn‚Äôt like the first one because she doesn‚Äôt want to look like a giant. The lighting isn‚Äôt great but the important thing was obviously Huntly in the background.

The ‚ÄúSouthern‚Äù lookout, towards Mount Ruapehu.

The photos may not capture it but we all liked this forest walk a lot. However we didn‚Äôt see many traps, and not many birds, which probably means there are lots of possums and other critters (later Lili actually saw a few in day light).

Not long after we got to the aforementioned grassy clearing. It‚Äôs pretty great. Not sure why Lili had to set up her tent so close.

Thought I‚Äôd share a little tour from inside the tent with my food bag and everything else around me while I wait for my noodles to cook.
