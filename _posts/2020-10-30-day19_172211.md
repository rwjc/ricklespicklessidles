Ruakaka Beach holiday park to Waipu Cove

17.19km ~ 3:47

In the morning I found Susan and Sally waiting for the tide to be not so frigging high before they do the initial beach walk. It turned out to be fine for them, and fantastic for me. It was probably my favourite beach walk so far. I don’t really know why but I was having lots of fun. It was probably the music. It blew away in no time. 

Also today I had quite a few food stops along the way.

First was a cafe just before the beach. A lady came and talked to me about the TA. It seems to happen more and more - people initiating chats when they see/smell me or my ginormous pack (I’d like to point out that from the different packs I’ve seen so far it is far from the most ginormous one).

Lili and Paul stayed behind and had a rest day.

Nicola and I pushed on. But I was the last to leave camp (as usual).

Looking back from the beach of Bream Bay shows a good profile of the elevation we did the day before on Bream Head.

I’m getting hairy.

I got to Waipu and found a hiker congregation - Susan, Sally, Nicola, and Charlotte! Charlotte came back to the trail after a stint in Whangarei. Susan recommended the oysters at one of the shops. So food stop #2 it is. Wonton soup and fried oysters. So good.

Nicola chowed down a mince and cheese pie and a custard pie and a coffee. I was impressed.

Sally and Charlotte will push on and camp at the trig point on the Cullen Brynderwyn Walkway. The rest of us decided we didn’t want to dry camp and head towards Waipu Cove instead. Maybe I should start doing more longer days...

At Waipu Cove there was a cute little library.

Kererus trying to eat from what I think is a loquat tree. How many can you spot?

Not much else interesting happens but here is probably the fastest sparrow I’ve ever seen.
