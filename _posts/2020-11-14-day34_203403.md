Hamilton to Karamu

21.73km ~ 5:39

Leaving soft beds is always hard, but in life you need to face hard choices and just do it. 

I had breakfast and thanks Chris and left to resupply at a local Countdown. Snickers was on sale. Yus!

I took a bus to Dinsdale, where the trail and, more importantly, a nice cafe is. Second breakfast!

In the first resupply I forgot about breakfast so I went back to another Countdown to get them. When I came out I bumped into Scott and Jane.

We met a man by his house. He yelled out “yes hikers!” as we walked by. Turns out he’s a section hiker and has done many parts of the TA. He is doing some renovation on his house and since it is directly on the trail he will start hosting and be a trail angel when it’s done.

We then got to Taitua Arboretum. It contains a lot of plants from different parts of the world. There are many walkways and places to sit and relax. We didn’t expect it to be so nice.

It seems to have a problem of rooster dumping though.

We walked through a “paper road” which Scott explained to me are roads that were planned but never made so farmers are allowed to graze them however they cannot bar people from accessing through it.

100 to 0 in 25 metres:

One of the worst things about road walking: here we were waiting for cars to go past so we can run across before the next one comes. This one was SH39.

We walked into Whatawhata, at a junction I’ve driven past many many times.

The couple had planned to stay here at the Backyard Bar (which is free to camp for TA walkers), but it seems like it’s going to be a rowdy night (being Saturday), I convinced them to continue on to the next place. After a beer of course.

Earlier today we found a tennis ball. For some reason I decided to keep it. I’ve been bouncing it on the road when it is quiet. It’s quite enjoyable and it seems to make me go faster. They joked about me carrying it all the way to Bluff. I don’t know if that’ll happen but I’ve given it a name - Tin Tin.

Last few km is a road walk to Karamu Valley Lodge - where we will stay the night.

It’s an amazing place. Paul and Heather are very accomodating and very friendly. Paul used to do a lot of mountaineering and is very interested in our camp set ups and gear.

You can get a cabin (of course Scott and Jane did that), or you can camp at a pretty reasonable price. You can even add a hot shower if you wish. 

The grass was probably the best I’ve camped on. A little guide for setting up my tent: first set up and stake down the fly, add the optional ground floor, then add the inner and you’re done!

A bacon and egg pie we picked up at a cafe in Whatawhata. Heather heated them up for us. Yum.

And, as promised. Doggos.

Lili got in later in the night. Glad she made it. 

Tomorrow - Pirongia; it is expected to be worse than Ratea Forest, a lot worse.
