I had breakfast at Bespoke Kitchen. Believe it or not the tomatoes were some of the best I‚Äôve ever had. Avocado smash.

Afterwards I looked around for a bike rental place with a shuttle service. Around The Basin was the cheapest. Also they could take me to Arrowtown at 10:30am and I could bike back to Queenstown at my own leisure. 

Howard took me in his van. I was the only customer in it. He is an avid trail runner. When [Brooke Thomas](https://fastestknowntime.com/fkt/brooke-thomas-te-araroa-nz-2021-01-22) came through Queenstown they ran together over the Motatapu in one day (it took us 3 days). 

Because it was Sunday, there was a market in full swing when we got there. We both went and got some food from the pastry stall. I also got some momos from a Nepalese stall.

Glad to be on a bike again.

The trail is nice for riding.

There were some alpacas that were without their usual fluffy coat. They look so weird.

Also, I‚Äôd like to report that some people were just married.

Oh deer me.

The Kawarau River.

Hey Billie it‚Äôs your bridge.

Old McDonald had a hill, e i e i o.

Little pony.

The _mighty_ Shotover.

Had a lunch and a dip here. Then I just sat for a long time in deep contemplation.

After getting back to Queenstown, I... actually forgot what I did. But eventually I caught up with Alex, Catherine, Charlotte, Keith. I bumped into Ben as well. He is staying at a BNB with Caleb and Joe. He‚Äôs got a new styling new haircut. After some kerfuffle we managed to organise a shuttle tomorrow to do the Routeburn. The Routeburn will be done (even though some had done it already). 

There‚Äôs nothing like a bit of TP in your free food only box.

I was craving for Japanese food so I went and got some.

I also had a bowl of ramen but the photo didn‚Äôt actually contain the bowl for some reason. It was out of whack. 


Tomorrow: like I said, do the Routeburn.
