Both Vlastimil and Wayne got up fairly normal-early and left. I only planned to stay a little bit longer, cooking up the pasta and beans and sausages I bought and didn’t finish yesterday.

Just before I was getting ready to pack up Brian walked in the dining room. He and Kelly had camped at the nearby railway station in their van. We had a cup of tea. He invited me to join him to Whanganui, do a little bit of the trail there, and maybe even go fishing. It was really tempting. But to do that and come back later to organise the canoe and do the walk to Whakahoro felt a bit too complicated at the time. We had a cup of tea and left our separate ways. I’m sure I’ll see them again. 

The rain started soon after I set off.

The Fisher Track is a cycle trail, part of the Mountain To Sea riding route. From National Park it is mostly a gentle downhill, through gravel and well formed tracks.

In good weather the vistas of the surrounding valleys would look amazing, I imagine. Even though the weather wasn’t the best today, I still really enjoyed the walk. Later a mountain biker rode by going uphill. He had parked his car at the top and is doing a yo-yo ride.

Public road FTW.

The second half of today was a road walk on quiet country roads. Half way through the rain stopped.

Camp tonight is beside a WWI memorial monument. There’s a toilet, a water tap set up by a local farmer, and lots of places for tents. There’s even a pretty cool horse statue.
