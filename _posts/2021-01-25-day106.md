Track is pretty tussocky. Charlotte said it‚Äôs like walking in a painting. She loves this stuff.

Weather has been pretty good. The sun was up and it got hot. The track was mostly southward, so in the morning the sun was to my left. I turned my hat sideways. It was not cool, but it helped keeping my face cool.

Lenticularly. (they‚Äôre probably not, I have no idea).

At the road Keith and I walked for a bit. Then he went for a pee so I got ahead of him. We had been trying to hitch but only one car went by for a few kilometres. I thought he would catch up but when I looked back he got a hitch and was putting his bag in the car. Ciara and Catherine turned out to be in there as well. As I started to run towards them another car overlook them. I stuck out my thumb and he stopped! His name is Rod üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø and he hardly drives that road. Because of this the other car went ahead. But they ended up picking up Malcolm further up so I got ahead again. I ended up being the first one to arrive at the YHA.

After checking in and a shower, we hit the cafe. The Greedy Cow. It‚Äôs really nice!

I then went to do my laundry, and lounged around. 

Charlotte had an innovative way of getting off the couch.

The local foursquare is also good. It looks new and has lots of stock. I did a little resupply and got some dinner (and ice cream to share).

Then I met up with the others in the pub next door. Shinanigans.

At 9:30pm there was a scheduled event near the lake. It was a ‚Äúbard‚Äù of some sort. I call him space wizard, since that‚Äôs what he mostly talked about. It was pretty cool. 

He started with a drum roll to get everyone‚Äôs attention. Charlotte joined in since she is into that sort of thing.

As the sky darkened more and more celestial bodies became visible. The moon, Sirius, the southern cross, Mars, Orion, Pleiades, etc. He recited poems, recalled Maori names for the stars and planets, and brought out some space gadgets. One of which was a galaxy model that lit up.

He passed it around. Malcolm and Ben playing with his galaxy:

I met Felix üá≥üáø and Dani üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø in the dorm room. Dani is going to Mt Cook tomorrow to do the Hooker Valley Track. She offered me a ride there in case I want to tag along! I would have loved to do that but I already booked the bike to get to Twizel. Argh bad timing. She seemed really cool. She is going to do some work for DOC down in the Catlins soon. 

Tomorrow: bike to Twizel
