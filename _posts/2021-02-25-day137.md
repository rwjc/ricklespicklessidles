description: muddiest day so far. But not too bad as I was able to avoid them pretty well. At least it didn‚Äôt rain and the sun was shining for most of it. Actually looking back today‚Äôs been really good. Best sunset ever.

Being silly with the shadows.

West Ruggedy Beach. What a great morning to be walking here.

Three tracks, three different stories.

![IMG_5820](/assets/images/20210225/img_5820.jpg)

There‚Äôs a seat in the middle of nowhere.

Angry bird. 

![IMG_5835](/assets/images/20210225/img_5835.jpg)

A fluffball without limbs. Retract legs, time to pounce. 

![IMG_5837](/assets/images/20210225/img_5837.jpg)

One of the nicer parts of the track. 

![IMG_5842](/assets/images/20210225/img_5842.jpg)

The Ruggedy Mountains.

Gotta sneakily include some photos of mud. Sorry it had to be done.

Big Hellfire Hut. I really like it. No sandflies, great views. 

![IMG_5881](/assets/images/20210225/img_5881.jpg)

It even has a sliding door.

The hut is at about 220m altitude. There‚Äôs a giant sand dune nearby that goes down straight to Big Hellfire Beach. Dirk üá≥üáø who‚Äôs at the hut and had a rest day said it took him 30min to go down and 45min to get back up.

Brad cooked a big plate of pasta. He added half a block of Parmesan cheese and half a block of butter. It smelled really good. Andrew üá≥üáø fried up some onions to add to his mash potato. It smelled really good as well.

We went out to see the sunset. It‚Äôs the best sunset I‚Äôve ever seen. Such a great place to view it - at the top of the sand dunes. I didn‚Äôt take a close up photo of when the sun is half submerged because I was taking a time lapse with my phone (EDIT: actually I just took a screenie from the video). The video turned out really well. The waves coming in all the way from the horizon, in addition to the sun itself, surprised me being so unbelievably beautiful. I cried on the inside.

Because of the orientation of the ridge you could see the moonrise as well!

Cheeky nighty snack.
