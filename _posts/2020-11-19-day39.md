Te Kuiti to Mangaokewa

34.52km ~ 9:31

Good morning Hunts farm!

Emma took me to the big statue at Te Kuiti town at 7am, where I resume the trail. She is lovely to talk to. 

On the way to the trailhead I met the Te Kuiti man. His name is Dave. He’s been hitching to work for 19 years. The other side of the sign says “Pirongia”.

The route that goes along Mangaokewa stream from Te Kuiti begins behind a sawmill. It’s terrible.

Once it got to the river the scenery improved drastically.

I disturbed a group of goats and they reluctantly retreated to the cliffs.

The **Mangaokewa Reserve Track** is very nice and well groomed. There are many waterfalls. You can even choose to walk either side of the river. Both has TA markers from some reason. I walked the one  that is _not_ on the TA gps (for 2020/21). Such a rebel.

When you reach this sign things will start to be thrown at you that make you wonder why you came at all. Now the **Mangaokewa River Track** begins and it is a whole different beast.

There are great views all along the river. But they are often connected by ridiculous sections through thorny blackberry, swamp, mud, eroded paths you need to scramble across.

My hands, arms, legs and clothes took a beating from the blackberry. They are so much worse than gorse. I have so many scratches. They burn.

I often let the stream wash my shoes and legs just by standing in it. But 5 minutes later they will be swamped again. There’s really no avoiding it today.

There was even a bit where the track turns towards the hills and climb steeply, sidles across uniformly steep landscapes, and then descend right back down the to river again! Can you please not do that???

Probably the youngest lamb I’ve seen so far.

Shower anyone?

Local farmers had set up a cute campsite for TA hikers. I decided to push on though to make tomorrow’s road walk to Pureora slightly shorter.

Up the road I walked by a lady who was checking out her honeybee hives. Her name is Alice and she wants to see if the hives are strong enough to be transported to a Manuka plantation. She is the owner of Waitomo Honey which is based in Te Kuiti. Alice has seen Wayne bit long ago. I hope I’ll catch him. 

I said good day and continued. 

Soon Alice drove up behind me and stopped.  She asked me “how heavy is your pack?” I thought that was an odd way to offer a ride. She then handed me a jar of honey. It is 1kg, locally sourced. My mind was battling itself internally. That’s way too heavy, you’ll be over encumbered!; but that’s free honey! It’s obvious who won.

### Shitty trail pro tip \#1 - how to instantly add 1kg to your pack weight

_chat up a bee keeper and have her gift you a jar of honey_

### Shitty trail pro tip \#2 - how to instantly remove 1kg of honey from your pack weight (r/ultralight_jerk inspired)

_don’t add it to your pack! Hold it in your hand and Now it’s just worn weight_

I don’t even have anything to eat it with. What am I even doing? What am I going to do with 1kg of honey??

And of course from there to where I plan to camp is all uphill.

![IMG_3746](/assets/images/20201119/img_3746.jpg)

I got to camp where we had to clear out any blackberry on the ground to pitch our tents. Don’t want to puncture the air mattress or anything else. 

I am very tired. 

Tomorrow - Pureora.
