Apple Dam campsite to Puketi Recreation Area

27km ~ 8:15

(In the middle my tracker magically paused itself so I filled in manually)

In the night our camp was attacked by possums. They are terrible. Many circled my tent. You can probably see when that happened:

We had heard there are possum activity at the Apple Dam campsite. So we protected our food well, and managed their smell. Having them making noises and hearing them walking around the camp so close is really  harrowing.

After this ordeal we got up early and left at about 7.

Why not, more graphs? Just one of those days.

Lots of ups and downs today. What’s different though is that the trail is the stream itself for about 3 kms. It is called the **Mangapukahukahu Stream**.

It’s probably the most interesting and fun section I’ve done so far. Wet shoes is normally an annoyance but here it is cool and refreshing. A bit slow going but it feels great. Would be even better if it was a blazing hot day for an early swim.

After the short stream walk we moved into the Bush. There were some fell trees and rough terrain, but not as bad as Raetea (everything is being compared to that now). But there are also some nice parts.

The track then connects to the Pukatea Ridge Track. It climbs for about 400m into a kauri forest. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of kauri trees. Many of which are massive! It’s another highlight of today’s sections.

The ridge track ends onto a gravel road. This bit was a bit boring and pretty hard to walk on.

Eventually we got to Puketi Recreation Area which is a pretty nice campsite. There’s also a hit which you have to prebook to get the access codes.

Tomorrow is Kerikeri. We cannot wait.
