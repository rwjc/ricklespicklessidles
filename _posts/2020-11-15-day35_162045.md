Karamu to Mt. Pirongia

26km ~ 7:49

We planned to start early, but agreed to define what ‚Äúearly‚Äù is for ourselves. I ended up leaving around 6:30. 

We left Waikato but now we‚Äôre getting right back into it. I didn‚Äôt know Waipa existed.

Really enjoyed the Karamu Walkway on this brisk morning. It passes through farmland and disused quarry.

This walkway is closed every year from 1 August to 31 October for lambing.

Just before an airstrip I saw something strange. I thought it was a cow on its legs. Note it was pretty far away. As I got closer it was a hiker wearing white and black. His name is Wayne. He was standing still but looking around to see where to go next. When I got up to him Jane and Scott showed up out of nowhere. Apparently they missed a turn and had to go around a hill. They had left earlier than I did.

We got to the Kaniwhaniwha campsite just before the climb to mount Pirongia on the Tahuanui Track.

Chilling and refuelling:

There was _some_ mud on the track up. I‚Äôve done it before and it was a lot dryer today. No knee deep swampy mud this time (although intel has it that the track down tomorrow will have exactly that).

Got great views at the top though! Along the way I‚Äôve past many day hikers. Some of them were up for a short chat.

The new and old Pahautea Hut. The first one for us on the North Island!

In the afternoon two overnighters came in with big packs. They came up the Hihikiwi track, the one we will be going down in the morning. They‚Äôve confirmed it‚Äôs really muddy and really slow going. Yay.


Tomorrow - trail angel not too far away.
