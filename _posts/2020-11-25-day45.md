Taumarunui to Hikumutu (and then hitched back to the TCH)

10:53km ~ 1:59

It poured down the whole night, like the forecast said it would. I even heard remote thunders. Last time this happened I was in Puhoi. At least I had better plans this time.

The plan was to just chill at Taumarunui Canoe Hire.

We went up to the main office where Karen conducts her business from. She made us coffee and toasted some homemade bread with homemade honey. In the office I met Tahlia, another TA hiker I’ve been following. She has been travelling around recently and now is back on the trail.

Bella somehow got out and stuck in the cold and wet. She came in shivering. It took some time to warm her up.

Brian was up as well. We were all assessing the river which had gained a lot of height overnight. And it was getting higher still. Something like 0.5m per hour. 

This was the last day here so we had to plan and book the journey itself.

Karen gave us a really good run down about the accomodation along the river and what we need to do. She is very helpful and efficient. 

Since it was still pouring we went down to a big lean-to for some chargrill prawns and capsicums, all thanks to Brian and Kelly. Another TA hiker dropped in at this time - Jaqui. She is a palates instructor.  They all know each other.

In the afternoon the rain has started to lift. Wayne and I decided to make this zero into a nero and do about 10km of the trial towards Owhango. Brian has offered to pick us up on his campervan when we finish; and he’ll take us back to where we stopped in the morning to continue the walk. He is a professional pilot and loves to take people places. 

I only took a little bag to put a water bottle and some snacks. I wore my rain jacket since it is still likely to rain a bit.

Why does this name have the words Rangiriri Pie but not actually have anything to do with Rangiriri Pies.

Tahlia had told us about a lone ostrich on our way. He has been there for 10 years but had not had the pleasure (I hear) of another ostrich’s company. He is very attracted to passing hikers and often would do the “dance” to woo them. We took a long time doing all sorts of things by the fence trying to get him to do the dance. It didn’t happen. It just followed us all the way down and up the fence line.

We were also told to checkout its _drumsticks_ which we agreed they are indeed muscular. 

The water is pretty brown after all the rainfall.

Goats on a hill.

For dinner we went to a local Indian restaurant which is probably the most classy one in town. Scott and Jane also arrived at Taumarunui today so I invited them over as well. It’s good to see them again.

We had all sorts of curries, mango lassi and naan. Yum.

I hadn’t seen it from the front before. Brian and Kelly’s campervan has an awesome adorenment.
