Koitiata to Bulls

30.98km ~ 6:23 hiking

4km hitching

The Koitiata motor camp non-powered sites after a night‚Äôs rain: waterlogged. Make sure you pick the elevated spots.

The track connecting to the beach is also pretty much fully submerged in water. Wet feet right of the bat. Yay!

Black sand and the west coast. Back to the oceans! Got 90 mile beach vibes.

After a length beach walk in on and off rain a marker took me into the Santoft Forest. It looks inviting but creepy. Feels like where a witch lurks and tries to lure hikers in and trap them forever.

A really big mushroom üçÑ

After the forest is again a length road walk to Bulls. With a few km left a car pulled up beside me. She rolled down the window,

<blockquote><small>"Want a lift?"</small></blockquote>

Yes please. 

Karen is also a trail angel who normally hosts hikers. But this year she is renovating her kitchen so had not advertised. She was driving to Palmy to get some supplies. During the ride suddenly screams and horror music started playing out of nowhere. Turns out it‚Äôs her ring tone. I didn‚Äôt ask any questions. Maybe I was caught by the witch after all. (To be honest she is fabulous and I wished her the best on her DIY projects).

The town of Bulls is very hospita-Bull.

I went to a burger place and had a da-Bull-burger and some chips.

Free fruits!

I got to the trail angels place and Tahlia opened the door! She looked like she lives there. It‚Äôs a very nice place. Lo√Øc (Frenchy), the host, is still at work. He is a helicopter pilot and was involved in many big recent events (rescue of two hikers lost for 3 weeks on the west coast in May, the White Island eruption). I met his dad, Patrick, who was from France. He has a lot of stories about flying, riding around New Zealand on a red Vespa, how to keep steak for long motorbike trips, how foie gras works in detail (yup it was fascinating but slightly uncomfortable), and escargots.

Nice bar and a mix.

There‚Äôs a spa but it was raining and I didn‚Äôt end up trying it out. 

Tahlia has been doing her thing and doing sections of the trail in different orders only she could manage. Today she used Frenchy‚Äôs bike and rode to Fielding so she could start the walk from there tomorrow (having convinced him to drop her off).

When Lo√Øc came in we shook each others hands and then a surprising thing happened. We both looked at one another and we both thought the other‚Äôs face is very familiar. We got talking and it turned out it we were in the same soccer team back in the day in high school! It was for the Takapuna Football Club and he even found our team photo from 1998!

I‚Äôm planning to do the same thing as what Tahlia did today. I will ride the bike to Fielding where Lo√Øc will come and pick it up and drop Tahlia off. This means I won‚Äôt have to wake up so early for a massive road walk to Palmy. Tomorrow Scott and Jane also planned to get there. Hopefully I will meet them somewhere. 

Before heading to bed we had some Genuine Bulls Cream. It‚Äôs delecta-Bull.
