Woke up without a destination to get to. South Island can wait. 

Susan went out for a walk early in the morning. She has a  very organised kitchen but there are a lot of shelves so it took a while to find what we wanted. 

After breakfast I walked down to the city. On the way I pumped into Tahlia who stayed with Phoebe. She was going to Te Papa and I tagged along.

The number of extinct animals in NZ is too damn high!

A friend came for lunch at Pickle & Pie in town. Daniel still looked the same as the last time I saw him.

After lunch genny and I went to a post shop looking to learn more about sending food parcels to Pelorus Bridge. Looks like it wouldn’t get there in time unless you use a very expensive courier option. This is to prepare us for the Richmond Ranges.

She came up with a good plan to buy the food at Picton which we’re told has a good food market. Put it with a backpackers we will stay at. Then do the Queen Charlotte track and get to Havelock. Hitch or bus to Picton to get the food parcel and continue on back. I think it makes sense. 

Hmm.

Happened to receive some photos from others with me in it. Throwback to a few days ago in a different world.

I went to a clothing repair shop for fixing the rip of my inner tent. Last time I had it fixed in Taumarunui but for my dumbness I ripped it again. This time the first shop I went into accepted my job (although somewhat reluctantly probably due to Xmas). I’ll go pick it up tomorrow. 

I also went to Bivouac to get some Radix meals and a pair of new socks from Icebreaker. My Darn Toughs are developing some holes at the bottom and I’d like to try something new. I hope these Icebreaker socks work well. I’ve loved my Darn Toughs. 

Since I had a backcountry hut pass over the COVID lockdown periods. DOC allowed us a 2 months extension for free. I had tried almost every DOC visitor centre along the country, starting from Northland. This is the first one that was open and actually know about this extension and could actually issue me a new pass. It’s good since my pass was just about to expire.

I got some fruits and ice cream to complement the dinner that Susan was making for us tonight.
