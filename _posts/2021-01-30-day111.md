Morning morning morning. Today will be a long day.

Poo with a view.

We climbed Martha Saddle.

Mt Aspiring is in the background.

Shawshank Redemption.

Hare. We couldn’t figure out how it died.

Top Timaru Hut. It’s good.

I like this photo.

From Top Timaru to Stodys we rebelled and walked in the river for awhile, because the trail is too undulating. But eventually we rejoined the track anyway. It’s indeed very undulating.

The climb to Stodys Hut was brutal but kind of fun. The hut, as many we’ve talked to has described it, “has character”. I agree with their assessment.

Caleb came in and collapsed on the ground.

I ate a lot for dinner tonight. It scared a NOBO. 

![IMG_4083](/assets/images/20210130/img_4083.jpg)

Today we met lots of NOBOs. Apparently the season for them has started so we expect to see a lot more in the coming weeks. We met Aaron 🇳🇿 and Aiden 🇲🇾. Aiden apparently called the police when he was surrounded by a herd of curious cows. We also met John 🇳🇿 and Rose 🇳🇿 who knew Catherine’s friend. There was also another guy who Catherine observed to be clean and has nice skin. At the hut three more NOBOs came and we got some intel about sections to the south. I doubt I will remember them.
