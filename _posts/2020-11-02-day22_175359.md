Pakiri to Matakana Valley

14km ~ 4:45

A short day. Mostly because I wasn‚Äôt sure if I want to include another big climb and descend of Dome Forest. It seemed more ambitious yesterday, but as I got near my planned destination today (trail angel Karen) it seemed doable. But it was at least another 15km and the weather forecast said it would start raining in the afternoon (surprise! It didn‚Äôt) and I decided to stay. And boy it was a good choice!

I waited for the store at the Pakiri holiday park to open. I pretty much ran out of sunscreen. Which is bad because there was a lot of sun. They had sold out. Bummer. 

A short road walk to the Pakiri town and the entrance to the track that goes over the summit of Mount Tamahunga.

As I climbed it got hotter but the views got better as well.

Burninating the countryside üéµ~ All you need are some thatched roof cottages.

Hot and sweaty. I met a bunch of cows cooling in the shade who would not budge from the trail. I had to go around sneakily. And thanks for the champions who paid for the extermination of gorse along the these parts!

You just hate to see it. After climbing the first peak, you have to go down into a valley before climbing back up to get to the actual summit.

There are only a few slightly muddy and slippery sections. If it rained a lot the days before that would be a different story. From the valley there are more tracks lined with giant gorse on either side.

The summit had a small view (not panorama) unfortunately. There‚Äôs also a helipad. Around the helipad there are quite a few suitable campsites.

But of course the main reason to go to the summit is to get good cell signal. How good is the signal strength here Rick?

It was here where I finally got a reply from the trail angel Karen. Who will happily host me. I was also happy because I don‚Äôt have to stealth camp somewhere anymore.

Before the long descent I also walked by a ‚Äúweather surveillance radar‚Äù. It‚Äôs big. Gotta keep an eye on those weathers, they are tricksy and steal your cookies when you‚Äôre not paying attention.

I got to Karen‚Äôs place which is near the top of a hill. They have a magnificent view.

When she finished remote working in a office made with stuffed straw bales, she came out and greeted me with tea! She‚Äôs English and must have tea the proper way.

Her daughter Isla, who just returned from school not long ago, brought up some food as well! Turns out they operate a catering business and always have a lot of left overs around. This time they had falafel wraps and sliders. I ate everything.

Tomorrow I‚Äôll do the Dome Forest track. I arranged with my friend Heather to help me resupply. Really looking forward to see her tomorrow.
