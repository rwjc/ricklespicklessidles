Te Rauamoa to Waitomo

35.40km ~ 9:27

![IMG_3564](/assets/images/20201117/img_3564.jpg)

Rained overnight, but cleared in the morning. I dried as much of the tent fly as I could, and set off at about 8am. 

Good morning! Wherever the ef I was.

Some dogs ran out of a driveway. They turned out to be friendly. (A important thing to note here is that not all dogs want pats. From me anyway)

We walked through back roads alongside farms.

We then connected to an unnamed bush track. A bit muddy but nothing compared to Pirongia.

Must not leave the bush line!

Coming up to a high point out of the bush, back on farmland. We met the farmer. He owns 3000 acres. We‚Äôve just been moseying in his backyard. He was super friendly. Basically all TA hikers go through his land. Scott and Jane are quite knowledgeable about farming so they had a good chat with him about lambs and other things farmers do with their time.

Oh no! Still 17km to go!

![IMG_3504](/assets/images/20201117/img_3504.jpg)

Time to play: follow the roller coaster fence!

![IMG_3506](/assets/images/20201117/img_3506.jpg)

No

![IMG_3508](/assets/images/20201117/img_3508.jpg)

No no no no

![IMG_3509](/assets/images/20201117/img_3509.jpg)

If the rest of the trail were like this we would just quit right now. It‚Äôs very demoralising. 

![IMG_3510](/assets/images/20201117/img_3510.jpg)

We past an airstrip that is more actively used. We‚Äôve been warned that we need to make sure we follow the instructions and stay out if there are activities, since there had been incidents with TA hikers almost getting decapitated by incoming planes. 

But today only cows were using it. 

![IMG_3511](/assets/images/20201117/img_3511.jpg)

We were still a wee bit high up. The others were going to have an early lunch. I wasn‚Äôt hungry (shocking I know) so I pushed on. Now begins the descent to Waitomo.

There was a large stream we needed to cross. It was clean and refreshing.

On the other side I had lunch and dried my tent in the sun.

![IMG_3545](/assets/images/20201117/img_3545.jpg)

I saw a trout in the water.

The climb up from the stream was a horse track. They can make the ground turn into something shitty:

Luckily I was soon connected to a shared mountain bike track where horses were not allowed.

![IMG_3549](/assets/images/20201117/img_3549.jpg)

These tracks have gentle gradient, dry leaf covering the ground, lots of shade. Very nice to walk on. It‚Äôs called the Waitomo Forest Access Easement track.

When I popped out on the road I met an old lady spraying her weeds. She lives right by the exit and she was wearing a Waitomo Caves hat. She was nice to talk to. She asked me where I‚Äôm from. I said Auckland. She laughed and told me that Aucklanders are naughty. We ignore distancing guidelines and the rest of the country suffer. Sorry ma‚Äôam. 

Ponga.

Once at Waitomo I had an ice cream at the General Store. It was getting too hot. I also got fruits and crackers. 

![IMG_3563](/assets/images/20201117/img_3563.jpg)

I waited for others and we had dinner at the store. The lady got both of my orders of beer and salad wrong.

![IMG_3565](/assets/images/20201117/img_3565.jpg)

I stayed at the local Top 10 holiday park and it‚Äôs really nice. 

![IMG_3566](/assets/images/20201117/img_3566.jpg)

Hot tub was worth it.

![IMG_3567](/assets/images/20201117/img_3567.jpg)

The lady at the reception said it had been super quiet and she needed to talk to someone. We had a nice chat later when I was having second dinner. Turns out she‚Äôs the only staff there since it‚Äôs been really slow.

Tomorrow will be a shorter day to Te Kuiti. Hopefully it‚Äôs not ridiculous.
