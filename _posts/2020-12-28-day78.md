title: Day 78&#58; Richmond Ranges 2️⃣ up up and away
description: I couldn’t follow Vlastimil and do his crazy mileage. Still a pretty hard day with 980m descent and 1.3km ascent. Another cozy jam packed hut.

Good morning!

I cold soaked my breakfast last night like the cool kids. There was a lot of activity really early on the morning so I got up early too. 

A group of three, Vlastimil, and Darcy took off one after another. I left about 6:40. Pretty early if you ask me. 

The forest is really nice. So far the track conditions feel a lot better maintained that the Tararuas. At least the tracks we’ve been through anyway.

For a brief moment I was out of the tree line and there were plenty of decent views.

I took the river route.

Lunch at Hackett Hut. Genny caught up to me here. The group of three were also here. They are staying here tonight since they have organised a food drop from the road close by. They are Ben 🇳🇿 (the one who did the TA in 2016), Luke 🇳🇿, and Emily 🇨🇦. They are from the Wellington tramping club and they are friends with Charlotte! Apparently she is starting the Richmond Ranges tomorrow and will meet them at St Arnaud and then they will continue on together.

A couple of trampers had a dog with its own backpack. (Sorry not a very good photo)

After Hackett hut the track turns into a _route_ and there are lots of water crossing.

It was hot and we came across a great swimming hole.

I just find this a bit funny.

The day ended with a tough and steep climb up to Starveall Hut. 

![IMG_1498](/assets/images/20201228/img_1498.jpg)

We met a local there, Tony, who is kind and lend us a fire starter. It’s been difficult making a fire since all the wood we have are damp.

Genny’s beef Indian curry pumpkin soup hodgepodge. Smells good.

Hut life.
