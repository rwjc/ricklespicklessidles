Bennett Road campsite, Ongarue to Taumarunui 

24km ~ 30min (hitch)

In the early morning I went to the loo. When I came back I accidentally put my weight on the zipper of the inner tent which wasn’t fully unzipped. The end result is the mesh at the top connecting to the zipper was ripped in two directions. It’s not minor but it may be fine if I am super careful. However it will mean that insects now have a way in. I hastily did some quick emergency sewing with headlamps but it wasn’t great. I had planned to go back to sleep but now I couldn’t. I will need to find a professional; hopefully I find someone in town.

To take my mind off this blunder I went to  the magic bus to have coffee with the others. Cam and Karen are going to Taumarunui today and they offered to take me there. I decided to go with them and do all the businesses I need to do in the day so I don’t need to rush in before shops close.

The first thing I did in town was a cafe stop.

At this point I’d like to mention that I’m past a third of the trail already! It was technically yesterday but close enough.

It doesn’t look like it but If I have my maths right 1000 is roughly a third of 3000. 

Second thing I did was to find a place to check in for the night. It’ll be a motel (living it up) tonight. I past on my first one which didn’t have studios with a proper kitchen available. I then went to Kelly’s Motel which did have some so I booked a room. It is run by a Japanese couple. I washed all my clothes and had a nap. 

Third thing I did was to try and find a tailor / seamstress / dressmaker / fabric-repair-person in this town. I went to two clothing stores. One gave me a number to call, another would do it but her expert will only come in 2 days time. Then I went to the local outdoor sports store. A lady there told me to go to a man in the backstreets who is handy with a sewing machine. His shop is called *Blackhawk*. It didn’t sound like a suitable name but people in the business probably can see the connection. Funny how the people at the clothing stores didn’t think to point me to this shop.

At the shop I met Kevin who was interested in the job. He told me to come back tomorrow afternoon and hopefully he will find a way to fix the rips. 

I walked around the main street of the town, sometimes the locals would talk to me. I had left my back pack at the motel so I just looked like a strange person with funny clothes. Maybe that’s how I normally look too.

I went to a bakery. It is a dangerous place.

Taumarunui is the _Heart of the King Country_.

Last thing I needed to do was to visit the library and use the computers there to sort out my finances. 

Wayne called me to tell me about the briefing meeting we will have tomorrow morning with the kayak/canoe hire operator  for the Whanganui Journey. Unless you want to go into the river at Taumarunui, there’s more planning and logistics involved. TA normally goes across at this point to do the Tongariro Crossing before shooting back and join the river further south at Whakahoro. In this case we will need to arrange to have the kayaks or canoes brought down there (with 5 or more days of food) and meet on a designated date. We will go to briefing and learn more about the details tomorrow. 

Then I went to New World and bought some dinner to cook at the motel. Weka (Susan) has spoiled me with this steak and asparagus combo.
