A similar routine as yesterday. 

Breakfast, then into town and do some more chores. 

Genny took me to a cafe she liked. Strata Bread Kitchen. She can’t have yeast but sourdough is fine.

I had a goats cheese and asparagus pastry thing and chai.

I sorted out (finally) the repair of my old phone with the shop back in Whanganui. They will courier it to the backpackers in Picton where we will stay tomorrow. 

I then went to the library to use their computers to make sure my finances are fine. They are kind of fine. 

Charlotte is in Wellington as well. She has hiked with Susan before so she was coming over for lunch. I got back to her place. Genny cooked a delicious meal with rice full of goodies, halloumi, and grilled apricot. Susan made some corn scones. I contributed by cutting some carrots.

Afterwards we had some desserts and food comad (I did, they seemed to be fine) in the lounge, catching up on what’s been happening with each other and other hikers we know. It rained a lot more than we expected. 

Later I went back into town to pick up my tent which was fixed (for the second time).

I don’t think I can recognise myself anymore.

This is the view from Susan’s lounge.

Tomorrow we will finally be on the move again and get on the ferry to Picton. 

Marlborough here I come!
