After doing the North West Circuit on Stewart Island, I went on the ferry to Invercargill in the morning. Brad and Alice had offered me to stay with them in Clydevale. They were coming over on a later ferry so I had some time to kill. I went to Queens Park which is fabulous. It had an aviary, a little animal farm, a cafe, all sorts of gardens, and loads of tracks. It‚Äôs wonderful. I wish Auckland had something similar.

Alice works at a dairy farm in Clydevale. She lives there too. I had a great time living among the cows. Brad is really into golding. He goes gold panning often. He was going to go to Arrowtown and Macetown and drive around the hills and valleys to pan. I will tag along to Queenstown to visit Ciara. The next day Alice was working from quite early. She popped in to have breakfast and say goodbye. I forgot to take a photo with them before she left but here‚Äôs a photo of a photo.

Cromwell and their massive fruit statue on the way to Q-town.

We had Fergburger when we got there, before Brad went off to gold. I tried to contact Ciara but she was at a friends place so we planned to meet for breakfast the next day. 

For dinner I had Korean.

Then I went back to the hostel where I met Tokoroa Paul. He had gotten to Te Anau but he came back to Queenstown for awhile for Maia‚Äôs 18th birthday party. Apparently Pip and Maia had just left that day. Would‚Äôve been cool to see them again after Whanganui River. 

I had breakfast with Ciara. She looked so good. I had not seen her in normal clothes. I forgot to take a selfie with her. Anyway, another teary departure I flew to Wellington, where Turbo Ben picked me up from the airport. I stayed at his lovely parents‚Äô, Sharon and Collin, place. Collin (we gave him his trail name - Turbo Daddy - even though we hadn‚Äôt meet him on trail, but we knew he was behind Ben trying to catch him). I said met Ben‚Äôs brother Sean again. 

Ben has two lovely cats.

The next day I had time to kill. I went to Zealandia. It‚Äôs a great place for birding. I saw robins, kakas, kererus, tomtits, and even a saddleback. I also popped in to see Susan, whom I met in Northland and stayed with when I walked throgg if h Wellington. It turned out she has a tramping trip with her friends in Arthur‚Äôs Pass and she will be driving down on Saturday! I needed to do that section I skipped due to bad weather and it‚Äôs just perfect timing. My ride is sorted.

The following day is the main reason I came to Welly. It‚Äôs Ben‚Äôs 21st and we had planned while on trail to celebrate it together. It ended up coming true and Catherine had organised a private hut in the Remutakas for us to do an overnight tramp. 

15.39km ~ 4:47 return

- Orongorongo Track to Jans Hut
- Cattle Ridge Track, Butcher Track to Catchpool carpark

![IMG_6525](/assets/images/20210307/img_6525.jpg)

Hiking together took us back. The track is really nice.

Catherine taught me her folding technique. I had already forgotten it. 

![IMG_6304](/assets/images/20210307/img_6304.jpg)

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening. 

![IMG_6309](/assets/images/20210307/img_6309.jpg)

Now I do know what‚Äôs happening here. We‚Äôre about to stuff our face. 

![IMG_6312](/assets/images/20210307/img_6312.jpg)

We played some games. Wine was consumed.

![IMG_6322](/assets/images/20210307/img_6322.jpg)

The next day we walked out. 

![IMG_6325](/assets/images/20210307/img_6325.jpg)

![IMG_6337](/assets/images/20210307/img_6337.jpg)

I found some bright blue berries. Not sure what they are. 

![IMG_6343](/assets/images/20210307/img_6343.jpg)

That night Catherine, Charlotte, and I went to see Big Ben and Emily. They are Cryalotte‚Äôs tramping club mates. I met them briefly in the Richmond Ranges. They are cool. They cooked us dinner. The homemade bread was fantastic. 

![IMG_6346](/assets/images/20210307/img_6346.jpg)

The next day I went on the ferry to Picton and met Susan and her friends. It was a long drive to Arthur‚Äôs Pass but we had a lot to chat about so it was fine. 

I stayed at The Sanctuary, again. If you‚Äôre doing the TA or just backpacking, go there. It‚Äôs great. I met lots of TA hikers here. The season is far from over. Annelies üáßüá™ (trail name Chanchita), Devon üá≥üáø (NOBO from Waikato; names her gear her whanau - Phoebe and Joey are her trekking poles, Aura her pack, Betsy her cooler, Sid her sleeping bag), Tim üá≥üáø, Dean üá≥üáø, Kerry (NOBO lady from Ahipara I first met on Mavora Walkway). 

The weather was not great the next day (it is supposed to rain from the afternoon). I decided to stay another night. In the morning I did the Avalanche Peak. It‚Äôs gorgeous. Saw many keas too. Annelies and I had a jolly of a time with the keas trying to eat our gear. 

10.53km ~ 4:08 

- Avalanche Peak Route
- Scott‚Äôs Track

![IMG_6527](/assets/images/20210307/img_6527.jpg)

It‚Äôs steep but the views are so nice.

The Devil‚Äôs Punchbowl.

![IMG_6516](/assets/images/20210307/img_6516.jpg)

After coming down I went to the DOC office to extend my backcountry hut pass. I liked this poster. 

![IMG_6528](/assets/images/20210307/img_6528.jpg)

We went to the Wobbly Kea for dinner. I had forgotten how big the pizzas were. 

Devon and Kerry had sent their first food supply box to Arthur‚Äôs Pass, from Invercargill. They sent it before they started the trail. So it was fun (for everybody) to see what they packed (and what they thought they needed). Actually they did a really nice job I thought. The bottle of Corona was genius.

Tomorrow we will all go our separate ways. I‚Äôm heading to Hamilton Hut. Last section. Should be good.
