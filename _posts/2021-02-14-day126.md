23.60km ~ 7:57

Aparima Hut to Telford Campsite

When we were about to leave Alex appeared out of the main hut. He must have done a humongous day to get here.

It rained overnight. I was under tree cover so it didn’t get too wet. It was drizzling in the morning.

I was following Ben and Catherine. Pro tip: always check, don’t blindly follow. I discovered we were going the wrong way and called them back. Luckily we didn’t go too far. Otherwise we would’ve gone a considerable distance to the road end and we probably would’ve hitched out.

There were some mud.

I love crossing slow flowing rivers (no sarcasm).

We had lunch at Lower Wairaki Hut.

It is Valentine’s Day apparently. Catherine made this and then wolfed it down.

The climb wasn’t too bad. It’s the last 1000m+ high peak/knob in the trail. I have mixed feelings.

Thanks for the compliment, orange marker!

Oh me too! Can we be BFFs?

Right after the climb the forest ended and we were on a cool ridge. I did not expect it and it made me happy.

The sun also came out. We had a good break here. My gullibility seems to have become public knowledge. Ben and Catherine pulled a prank on me, telling me what the names of the mountains around us are called. “They are named after Swedish sailors” (or some nonsense). I need to be more careful. In any case, we could see the ocean. That means we are getting close... to the end.

Ben about to engage turbo mode.

The sandfly situation at Telford Campsite is bad. Hopefully it doesn’t get too windy or too cold during the night.

![IMG_4872](/assets/images/20210214/img_4872.jpg)

The sandflies are so bad that Ciara bravely cooked in her tent. Ben and Catherine went back up the hill to find some place less crowded. 

![IMG_4874](/assets/images/20210214/img_4874.jpg)

![IMG_4880](/assets/images/20210214/img_4880.jpg)

Debbie, Charlotte, Alex, and Duncan (SOBO) joined us later. Alex has been going in others people’s tents and lie down to see if it will fit him. He is quite tall and wants to get a new tent.

Charlotte set up her tarp and bivy using Ciara’s tent. So ultralight. 

This is for tomorrow. Apparently the station owners really don’t like TA walkers. I’m positive it’ll be alright.
