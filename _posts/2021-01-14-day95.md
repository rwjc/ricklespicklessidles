Morning! It’s going to be another hot day. We will cross the Southern Alps via Harper Pass.

A view of the triple bunks system of No. 3 Hut.

Chris and Dani went the wrong way. So they back tracked.

Hopscotch time. Not that I know what it is.

Our first 3-wire swing bridge. It’s pretty fun!

Waiting in line to check out the rustic Camerons Hut.

There were... some mud.

Harpers Pass Bivvy is cozy and cute. Rescue Orange for the win.

Harpers Pass is full of overgrown vegetation. Flax galore.

Over the pass you could get a clear view of the valley and Taramakau River.

Rata!

We had lunch at Locke Stream Hut. I had another nap. 

![IMG_3015](/assets/images/20210114/img_3015.jpg)

I like it when huts come with info about their history. All huts should have it.

![IMG_3013](/assets/images/20210114/img_3013.jpg)

Apparently this hut has a nickname. 

![IMG_3014](/assets/images/20210114/img_3014.jpg)

Dandelion fields aplenty. The markers down this side is pretty sporadic and often hard to find. Lots of times we just ploughed down the river since that’s where we need to go anyway. 

![IMG_3019](/assets/images/20210114/img_3019.jpg)

![IMG_3024](/assets/images/20210114/img_3024.jpg)

![IMG_3030](/assets/images/20210114/img_3030.jpg)

Kiwi Hut. Sweet as. 

![IMG_3032](/assets/images/20210114/img_3032.jpg)

After dinner I went to the river. Took all my clothes off and lied down in the water. It was so nice. 

![IMG_3037](/assets/images/20210114/img_3037.jpg)

The fish pie Dani made for Chris and herself.

We met some NOBO Kiwis who came in about about 7pm. Ben from Cambridge, Alesha from New Plymouth, and Quinn from Nelson. They had a long day coming through the Mingha and Deception Rivers. We will do that tomorrow. Hopefully the weather is good, since Deception is meant to be treacherous if it is not. I learnt that there is a NOBO Guide which is more detailed and better in general than our SOBO trail notes. 

Tomorrow: Upper Deception Hut.
