Morning! It’s going to be another hot day.

A view of the triple bunks system of No. 3 Hut.

Chris and Dani went the wrong way. So they back tracked.

Hopscotch time. Not that I know what the rules are.

Our first 3-wire swing bridge. It’s pretty fun!

Waiting in line to check out the rustic Camerons Hut.

There were... some mud.

Harpers Pass Bivvy is cozy and cute. Rescue Orange for the win.

Harpers Pass is full of overgrown vegetation. Flax galore.

Over the pass you could get a clear view of the valley and Taramakau River.

Rata!

We had lunch at Locke Stream Hut. I had another nap.

I like it when huts come with info about their history. All huts should have it.

![IMG_3013](/assets/images/20210114/img_3013.jpg)

Apparently this hut has a nickname. 

![IMG_3014](/assets/images/20210114/img_3014.jpg)

Dandelion fields aplenty.

Kiwi Hut. Sweet as.

After dinner I went to the river. Took all my clothes off and lied down in the water. It was so nice. 

![IMG_3037](/assets/images/20210114/img_3037.jpg)

The fish pie Dani made for Chris and herself.
