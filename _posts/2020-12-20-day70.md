Today I finished North Island of the TA. Yay!

I had breakfast with Emma and Chris. Their cats joined as well. Bumble has a microchip-enabled feeding device that only provides her food. Also I discovered that they have smart tech all over the house and OK Google is used liberally. Ah the future is here.

They are going to do a run of the Jumbo/Holdsworth circuit in the Tararuas. Before that, Emma dropped me off at Ngaio Centre where I arranged to meet with Tahlia, who was dropped of by Phoebe.  

We got there at about 9:30am and we began our assault of Mt Kaukau. The winds were a lot calmer than yesterday and it was a leisurely walk up to the summit.

Emma has packed a a bag of the homemade bread we had last night. I shared some with Tahlia. It was delicious. 

Afterwards we continued on the Skyline Walkway for a bit before going back down the ridge into the suburbs.

Tahlia: “So hood”

We walked through a surprising great little track through Trelissick Park.

The Northern Walkway has great views of the stadium and the harbour.

Part way through we met Tahlia’s friend Ayesha. She walked from the other side of this part of the track to meet us somewhere in the midde and planned to walk the rest of the way with Tahlia to the end. Ayesha has done the PCT twice and her trail name is “Heaps”.

I learned that Tahlia has a crush on Aunty Cindy and is really excited about the Beehive. Here’s a non portrait mode version.

Today the weather in Wellington was almost perfect, Ayesha reassured us. 

There are numerous plates mentioning the TA trail on many roads in the Wellington CBD. I don’t know if they only exist on roads that go through the actual trail itself.

Cuba St and the infamous Bucket Fountain.

We were really hungry. Soul Shack fixed us.

At this point Genny came to meet us. She had already done Mt Kaukau yesterday so today she started much further on than us and had reached Island Bay (final point of the North Island track) already. I don’t know why, but they gave hera much bigger portion of chicken and grilled cauliflower than ours. It was a feast. 

Wellington waterfront.

Real fruit ice cream.

We climbed to the top of Mt Victoria. There were nice views of the harbour and the south coast.

There was a slide near the top!

We spent ages here. Slide shinanigans (I think I overuse this word. But then again it has a wide range of uses).

Forwards and onwards.

Came across these cute sets just by the track.

Going down a hill for the last time on the North Island. We reached Island Bay. A tad bit emotional.

Another of Tahlia’s friend, Dave, was there waiting for her near the park. He’s also a software guy and he plays badminton too. 

At the (small) monument marking the end of the island for us.

Dave took us to Parrotdog Brewery at Lyall Bay. He shouted us drinks and I had a healthy salad, slightly less healthy fries, and an absolutely positively healthy drink.

Tahlia enjoys being a nuisance.

At the end he took me to Susan’s (Weka) home up in the hills in Aro Valley. I last left her in Waipu Cove. Is good to see her. Her house is very impressive. Hard to get to, but it has a great view of the city and the sea. Genny had been chilling here for awhile. Susan showed me around and we chatted for a bit before I had a shower and retired. 

To summarise today; long day but done with leisure, good food, and great company.
