In the morning we said goodbye to Andrew and Helen, and set off towards the ocean through the Waikanae estuary track.

We walked through Paraparaumu Beach and Raumati Beach. The tide has started to come in and we got off the beach and walked along a gravelly track further inland. There were great views of the Kapiti Island.

Tahlia caught on the beach with a dog walker. Not the first time. She attracts people.

After the beaches we got to Queen Lizzy’s Park. There re lots of projects here regenerating native plants and habitats for birds.

On the phones, navigating, I think.

Kiwi as. Merry Xmas.

We had lunch when we got to Paekakariki. Tahlia’s friend Magenta came to do the escarpment track with her. But lunch is the first order of business.

Pork. Ribs.

![IMG_0810](/assets/images/20201218/img_0810.jpg)

Thanks for the great work. 

![IMG_0811](/assets/images/20201218/img_0811.jpg)

Aww.

All of us had food comas and we eventually got our bloated bellies (or maybe it’s just me) to the start of the escarpment track.

It’s got great views and it’s fairly straightforward. If you have a super sunny or super windy then it’s another story.

At the end we reached a dairy and got ice creams. 

![IMG_0846](/assets/images/20201218/img_0846.jpg)

I ordered a 2 scoop but got 3 instead.

Another of Tahlia’s friend showed up. Phoebe brought some fruits and gave me a ride to my friends place. I got to Vipul’s and met his wonderful family. They have a mansion of a house and kept me entertained until Vipul came back from work. Nikita had already prepared a mouth watering dinner for us. After refreshing myself I enjoyed an authentic home-cooked Indian feast which I was sure to have a second food coma later.

Vipul told me that some peeps from work are hanging out and asked me if wanted to go. Of course! I had almost forgot how capable some of them were at shinaniganian behaviour. You  probably can see of whom I speak.

At this moment I’ve left Tahlia and Genny who have been awesome to hike with. Who knows when we’ll catch up again but it’ll be interesting to go on by myself again into the city. 

Tomorrow: I’ve no idea.
