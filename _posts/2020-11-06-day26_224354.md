Red Beach to Stillwater

16.76km ~ 4:11

Slept in. The body needed to heal after battling in the cold and wet yesterday. Fortunately it has all started to die down during the night.

I found that a hyper-energetic dog can really slow you down in the morning. After I helped Heather with some things I bid farewell (for now) and went on my way. Heath was interested in coming along to do the kayaking in the Whanganui river section which would be rad.

Some suburban streets later I got back on the trail. This time it’s the Orewa estuary Walkway. It meanders around the Orewa river, eventually going through several schools which all happened to have all of the children outside in probably the noisiest cacophony I’ve experienced in a long while.

I got to Silverdale and there was a bakery touting its award winning pies. I wasn’t overly impressed to be honest.

Going further there was good signage. I ended up in another cafe where I stayed a long time. Mostly because I wasn’t in a hurry, and I ordered a Chunky monkey thickshake and a mushroom hash browns dish which I thought was average. The thickshake was extra thick though.

After this long break I embarked on the dreaded road walk to Stillwater. It has insufficient verges to dodge fast traffic and has a lot blind spots. I waited until the afternoon before rush hour to try and minimise the number of cars I will meet. There were still a lot. Anyway it needs a lot of focus and care. Be safe.

I eventually arrived at the Stillwater motor camp. I heard its owners are really TA friendly. But tonight I was going to stay at my sister’s partner’s family’s house. I was really looking forward to that.

I waited at an excellent reserve next to the camp for Jess to come fetch me. I even  managed somehow to do some pull-ups so I won’t become totally useless when I go back to Kaz at the end.

Turns out all of Jake’s siblings plus grandparents, are there too! Jolly good fun and the food was amazing. Although it felt very christmasy. Not sure if I’m ready for that yet.

Tomorrow Jess and I (yes she wanted to come along for a bit) will try to beat the tide and ford the Okura River. Jess didn’t realise that low tide was going to be 6:25 am and is probably now regretting everything.
