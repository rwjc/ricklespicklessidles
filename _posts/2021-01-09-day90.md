Blue Lake Hut to Waiau Hut

- Waiau Pass Route

The heavy rain came in during the night. The forecasted rain I had wanted to avoid when I started from St Arnaud finally arrived. It stopped in the morning. Very good timing.

We stopped by Blue Lake again to see if it was better. (Yesterday when I went it was drizzling so the water surface was not calm). It was better.

It was still misty though. We were hoping that it I‚Äôll clear up. The forecast said it would. ü§û

When we reached Lake Constance, the clouds thinned and soon disappeared. I took so many photos of Lake Constance today OMG.

Note to people doing this track SOBO: if you follow the cairns to the lakeside, you‚Äôll need to climb back up because the route goes over a tall bluff. (We totally didn‚Äôt go the wrong way). 

After some steep up and steep down, we got to the side of the lake anyway and walked towards Waiau Pass. 

![IMG_2545](/assets/images/20210109/img_2545.jpg)

The pass is somewhere to the left of middle.

Starting the climb. 

![IMG_2562](/assets/images/20210109/img_2562.jpg)

Halfway up. Lake Constance in the back. Ciara and Paul (from Hawks Bay) in the front. 

![IMG_2577](/assets/images/20210109/img_2577.jpg)

Top of the pass. The climb wasn‚Äôt bad. 

![IMG_2583](/assets/images/20210109/img_2583.jpg)

Oopf. Looks worse than it is.

Also we passed 2000km just after Waiau Pass! Yay üéâ

Malcolm üá≥üáø caught up to us when we about to leave the top. 

![IMG_2597](/assets/images/20210109/img_2597.jpg)

![IMG_2599](/assets/images/20210109/img_2599.jpg)

![IMG_2600](/assets/images/20210109/img_2600.jpg)

Coming down was slightly technical in bits. There was a ‚Äúrocky chute‚Äù and some hands on work. But it‚Äôs not too bad. 

![IMG_2610](/assets/images/20210109/img_2610.jpg)

Ciara and her Sticky. It got shorter and shorter because she was yeeting them down the track every time we needed our hands to climb.

![IMG_2625](/assets/images/20210109/img_2625.jpg)

Lunch time on top of a table rock. 

![IMG_2635](/assets/images/20210109/img_2635.jpg)

Someone put ‚Äú2001K‚Äù in rocks. It‚Äôs not anywhere near the new TA km marker or the one for last year. Maybe it‚Äôs even older. 

![IMG_2641](/assets/images/20210109/img_2641.jpg)

In the valley we walked by the Waiau Uwha River and in many places it opened up in big open expanses. It was great. 

![IMG_2649](/assets/images/20210109/img_2649.jpg)

![IMG_2651](/assets/images/20210109/img_2651.jpg)

![IMG_2654](/assets/images/20210109/img_2654.jpg)

![IMG_2658](/assets/images/20210109/img_2658.jpg)

We passed Caroline Creek Bivvy. There were tarps and tents already set up here. They were hunters but no one was in. Their guns were just lying about and the fire was still smouldering. 

![IMG_2656](/assets/images/20210109/img_2656.jpg)

We had a nice long break in the grassy meadow next to a log. Surprisingly there were very few sandflies. 

![IMG_2660](/assets/images/20210109/img_2660.jpg)

There were quite a few river crossings today in the valley. Wet shoes day.

![IMG_2664](/assets/images/20210109/img_2664.jpg)

Waiau Hut. It‚Äôs quite new and cute. Sandflies do get inside though through the windscreen whose mesh is not fine enough. 

![IMG_2672](/assets/images/20210109/img_2672.jpg)

View from the hut.

Such a cracking day. One of the best. *Do this hike* (or others around this area it‚Äôs gorgeous). 

Tomorrow: Anne Hut.
