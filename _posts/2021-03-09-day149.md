Ed and Lydia were the NOBOs that came in last night. They camped outside because they are smart. It was loud in the hut. I went to the loo in the middle of the night and star gazed. I should have done more of that on the TA. 

Alexa took off first. She was going the way I came from yesterday. I said bye to Susan for the n-th time and went the TA SOBO way, towards Lake Coleridge. No one else was going that way. 

Today‚Äôs track started in the forest. It then follows Harper River downstream towards Lake Coleridge. Weather was fine.

The track is 4wd and is pretty flat. Lots of river crossings though. 

Half way through are The Pinnacles rock formation. Not quite the ones in Coromandel but they are also neat.

The water is nice.

I was confused about comments about this point of the river. It‚Äôs reported to be deberteet ü§î.

Finally I could confirm this personally. The river is indeed deberteet.

Thanks to Transpower for providing a free campsite.

I‚Äôm the only one here. There were a couple of cars that came in to use the toilet, but otherwise it feels quite remote. Mountain views all around.

Just before Stewart Island I sent my tent home, thinking I won‚Äôt be needing them. What a mistake. No hut here. I bought the cheapest tent from the Blenheim Macpac on the drive down. Luckily there was a sale. 

And this is the first time ever pitching it. It took me ages.

This reminded me of Spider-Man.

I had a little dip in the deberteet river nearby. It‚Äôs cold and fast but really nice.

Forecast said it will pour tomorrow. Not looking forward to that. Although things are no doubt rolling in. No escape.

Survivorman.
