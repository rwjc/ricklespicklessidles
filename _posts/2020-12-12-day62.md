Moturimu Whare to Tokomaru Shelter

16.19km ~ 5:53

- Burttons Track

In the night rain kept coming back. But then I realised it’s just Genny’s air mattress. The weather is supposed to improve today. We shall see. 

Leaving the cool Whare just before we left off.

Burttons track is a proper bush track and I’ve really enjoyed it. It’s been awhile since I’ve been on one and it’s great.

There are lots of river crossings though. Even though there had been rain the previous days the water levels are fine. At most it was thigh-high. 

Genny and Tahlia have sandals which they changed to before the first crossing. Tahlia likes to remind me about their dry socks and dry shoes whenever she gets the chance.

It’s pretty fun even though the water current was strong.

Lovely.

Nothing can stop us from smiling

Well except maybe the big slips that seem to have formed not long ago. The loose rocks reminded me of Tongariro crossing.

Water, water, everywhere. And you can drink every drop.

Picked up a cute hitchhiker. 

![IMG_0350](/assets/images/20201212/img_0350.jpg)

Then two wild hikers appeared.

Today hasn’t been Genny’s day. She has had a few falls and tumbles over slippery rocks and banks. But she is really strong and her determination gets her through everything. We discussed a possible trail name for her - Bottoms Up.

Tokomaru Shelter. Better than it looks. 

![IMG_0354](/assets/images/20201212/img_0354.jpg)

Shuffles in her zen mode. 

![IMG_0356](/assets/images/20201212/img_0356.jpg)

Genny made us bracelets! She let us choose the colours. Choice overload. I ended up with green, white, and yellow.

Her dinner. Just add water. Freeze dried mince, mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, spices, tomato purée. Very nice.
