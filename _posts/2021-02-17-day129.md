This morning my tent froze. It was really cold. Probably the coldest camp I‚Äôve been in. Thanks Southland.

Today we will do the final forest of Southland; the final forest of Te Araroa - Longwood Forest.

The forest is really beautiful.

There were some mud. But it wasn‚Äôt too terrible. The weather was great though, I had a nice time.

We got above the treeline for some time as well. They were often boggy too.

I hiked with Charlotte for a while, especially through the really muddy parts.

She thought I wasn‚Äôt muddy enough so she started flinging mud at me. Thanks, ‚ÄúMudslinger‚Äù. But she didn‚Äôt really need to do that because I fell into a deep mud pool later anyway.

There was a disused quarry in the middle of the trail.

The views at the top were very nice. We could see the south coast.

The two little bumps in the distance is Bluff! So close!

![IMG_5192](/assets/images/20210217/img_5192.jpg)

Martins Hut is small, rustic, and cute. 

![IMG_5194](/assets/images/20210217/img_5194.jpg)

To wash off the mud on our shoes and ourselves Ben and I bush bashed to the north of the hut where we found a little stream which could let us do just that.

Duncan made us a really nice fire.

The hut is really dark so Catherine hung her headlamp to give us some light.
