Cape Reinga to Twilight Beach Camp üèï

Final flat-white and buttie for the road.

After some drama on the road and a few dairy stops we finally made it to _the_ lighthouse.

Obviously we spent way too much time posing at the sign. Luckily there was one (and only one) other person there so we asked him to take the photos for us.

Said the goodbyes, hugged, and never looked back (that‚Äôs not true, I looked back at least once).

I totally forgot about checking the tide. But it turns out absolutely fine.

First day had a small stream crossing, sand dune climbing, and some pretty contrasting landscapes.

Made to the first campsite. Met section hikers Paul and Barbara, (whose nephew? Son‚Äôs friend? Something? Geoff Henderson broke the TA supported record 2019 in something like 49 days!!)

I was expecting lots of rain today (thanks weather forecast). But it was only overcast which made great hiking weather (not great for views though).

Overall great first day!
