We got up and had a great breakfast with salmon, bread, and spinach/kale combo. Went to the kayak rental place at the beach at the agreed time. But it turns out he wanted us to delay our start time to make it to the end on high tide. So we had about 1 hour to kill. We decided to go back to Pickled Parrot to chill and have another coffee. We had a lovely chat with the hosts Cherry and Jay. Jay had done the TA last year, and so treats other TA hikers very well. Discounts and some free food. It’s lovely seeing the magic on the trail circles back year on year.

Nick from Bay Beach Hire helped us with the gear our sea route through to Waikare. He will pick us up at our destination at 2pm and it should take us 4 hours, with a nice lunch stop about midway at Marriot island.

After the kayak section, we refuelled and walked towards Russell Forest. A local trail angel Sheryl happened to drive pass with two other TA hikers in the car, who are going to stay at her place tonight. Hers has been highly suggested by others on the trail. She offered us to stay with her and  I would totally do so but it was a bit early and we still have quite a bit of time to hike. So I had to unfortunately decline. A bit gutted but I thanked her and asked her about the conditions of Russell forest. Maybe I will see those other hikers in the days ahead.

We pushed on and there was Papakauri Stream, where we completed our second stream walk so far. This one was a bit longer than the first and it was just as excellent.

When we got out the sun is getting pretty low. We were on country roads and a farmer or two don’t have functioning fences and their cattle just wonder all over the place. It turns out the council gets a lot of complaints about this and they have been “working with” those farmers but nothing seems to get fixed.

Finally we arrived at the best trail angel I’ve been at so far. Sue and Al in Punaruku are so accomodating and are super friendly. Their place for hikers are sooo goood. If you’re hiking through make sure to try and plan it to stay here!

Tomorrow Lili will go find her partner Hugo (who will bring her dog Rudi) so I will probably say goodbye for some time. Hopefully we’ll meet again somewhere on the trail. On and labour day weekend will mean it might get hard to book anything anywhere. Better stick to trail angels who are far superior as far as I’ve seen.
