Camp Bay to Cowshed Bay

24.5km ~ 7:36

In the night a couple who pitched their tent really close to mine were talking loudly till late. I’m not sure they realise tent walls don’t actually block sound. Or maybe they didn’t care. Weather in the morning was foggy and drizzly. Genny and I were the first group out of the camp.

Thanks for letting us through private landowners.

It’s often the case in New Zealand. You think you’re in a remote part of the country. Then wham bam farmland thank you very much.

Misty mountain hop.

Rain started getting a little bit heavier. But still has decent views along the way.

Genny got a new rain jacket. She likes it more than the last one.

The best kind of table.

How nice the trail is.

Can’t get lost with these.

Wavey.

Weka target locked. Straight for the gear.

The sun came out blazing and we were hungry. So we had lunch at Black Rock Station picnic table and put out the washing.

It was getting really hot and we had no shelter so I lend Genny to try the umbrella. It helped.

Cheeky bugger trying to get at my tent.

Back on trail with more views.

At the Black Rock Campsite we met Jo who is on holiday. She turned out to be the partner of James at Nikau Eco camp in Ngunguru. They had bought that property together. Small world! We were again attacked by wekas.

Not long after we arrived at Cowshed Bay campsite. It’s by the road so there are some campervans here. Luckily for us they are all on the other side of the camp.

I had a dip in the sea it was great.

Bad news. There are some mouldy bits on my mattress ☹️. I last used it in Nichols Hut in the Tararuas and it must have gotten damp. I had forgot to air it out so this happens.

Normal dinner. Double portions. 

![IMG_1318](/assets/images/20201225/img_1318.jpg)

But with a twist. Backcountry dessert.

It is okay. Genny had apricot crumble and it tasted way better.
