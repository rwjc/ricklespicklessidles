It‚Äôs good to stay put and recuperate after going nonstop from Cape Reinga.

If you walk from Hone Heke lodge to the town centre by road then it‚Äôs a good 20 min walk. But you can cut through diagonally via the school fields which is a lot faster and more scenic.

Since the lodge is popular for worker/travellers, pretty much everyone else who stayed there got up and left pretty early. They are essentially a group of flexible and energetic labourers who can be hired to do any sort of work and the hosts of the lodge will take them to their employer of the day in the morning.

I naturally took my sweet time getting up, since I‚Äôm not planning to do any hiking today.

I visited a cafe for breakfast. On the way a bookshelf displayed it‚Äôs wares outside. Lo and behold, Cheryl Strayd:

The breakfast in all its glory (from the Village Cafe):

Along the way to the town centre is a rock sculpture with water features:

I went to the library to use the computer to check up on the financials, and then went to New World for a small resupply to Paihia.

Simon was in town as well and Lili bumped into him. Apparently he had some problems with a particular blister and the doctor suggested that he chill, which he was going to do anyway.

In the afternoon I went back to the lodge to share the laundry load with Lili. The problem with doing the laundry when you want to wash everything is that you have nothing to wear while all of your clothes are being washed and dried. Lili decided to buy a pretty dress from a local shop, whereas I wore my rain gear (jacket plus pants). Here‚Äôs the result:

I know which of us look more inconspicuous.

We went to the fishing and hunting store. It‚Äôs pretty well stocked. We got more gas canisters and I got some tenacious tape, just in case.

For dinner we decided to go Turkish. I ordered the dish with **everything**. It was actually too much. Large here means _large_.

Coming back Lili went to rest early. I stayed in the common room to socialise some more.

A young German girl who was obviously super high on sugar told me her story about how she came to stay with her kiwi family. She didn‚Äôt plan anything. She just arrived in Auckland, looked at a map, saw a river she liked (I think it was the Waikato river), took the train as far south as it goes to Pukekohe, hiked (with everything she brought from Germany) for 2 hours aimlessly, felt tired and took a break, saw a cute dog in front of a house, walked towards it and a man there saw her and asked her what she was doing and where she was planning to stay that night, and got her sister to take her in for a bit. Somehow now she is in Kerikeri.

I was also reunited with Susan (Weka) who I first met in Hukatere Lodge on the 90 Mile Beach. She was with her friend Penny who was following her progress in a car, and two other TA hikers - Paul (different Paul from the one I met on the first day; he is from Tokoroa), and Sally. We had shared some more fun hiking stories and other things. Catherine (Irish girl who has regularly work-stayed here for 4 years) also joined us.she had a giant bag of popcorn and is relentless at filling our bowls until I could eat no more. Originally I had brought some baklava from the Turkish place to save for later but I shared them as well. They went down really well.

I also met a Japanese couple who were cooking up a storm. I couldn‚Äôt quite understand what they were trying to make but it turns out that it was the guy‚Äôs turn to cook and he wanted to impress his partner. It looked pretty nice. It invoked lots of meat.

Lili and I are planning to go to Paihia tomorrow. But the scheduling is a bit tricky. We want to kayak from Paihia/Opua to Waikare in the days after. But that requires non-windy conditions and also the weekend is all booked out (Labour weekend). So we will have to do it on Friday, and weather forecast is not looking good. We shall see tomorrow (which looks like it‚Äôs going to rain all day üò≠).
