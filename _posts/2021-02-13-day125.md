Princhester Road to Aparima Hut

- Princhester Saddle Track

I booked a shuttle for us 10 minutes before it was scheduled to arrive, at 7am. We were still rushing to clean up our breakfast when it came. They took us to Princhester Road which is where the trail resumes.

Turbo Ben as usual shot off right away. Debbie has joined us for this section. She has a lot of white shirts which she somehow manages to keep white this whole time.

It‚Äôs an easy gravel road into the forest.

Lower Princhester Hut.

The bush was nice but sometimes quite muddy.

There were open tussocky areas as well. The grasses were often very tall and sometimes they would obscure the markers. It can also be quite boggy. Sometimes there are bog holes and the long grass cover them. It‚Äôs easy to fall into one if you‚Äôre not careful.

I managed to be in the front for a long time. I found a nice grassy area among the tussocks and had my footlong.

On the trail I met three hunters and their lovely dogs. They are really friendly. The hunters asked me if I saw any pigs or deer. I didn‚Äôt but I wasn‚Äôt really looking for them. Also I probably made a lot of noise walking. Apparently there was also a lady hunter who is the wife of one of the guys in the group. She went a different way.

Short waratahs like these can‚Äôt be seen from far away. 

![IMG_4797](/assets/images/20210213/img_4797.jpg)

Not long to the hut.

Aparima Hut. There is the hut itself and an older rustic hut right next to it. We heard that there is a lady with her four kids coming this way. Also we thought the hunters were coming back to stay here (their packs are inside). So we decided to claim the rustic one.

When Ben and I first got to the hut there was a couple day hikers. Petr üá®üáø and Cata üá®üá¥. We had a friendly chat. They gave each of us an apple. It was really nice.

I checked out the nearby river and swimming hole. If the weather was really hot it would be very handy.

![IMG_4806](/assets/images/20210213/img_4806.jpg)

I ended up deciding to camp under the trees at the back. I want to do more camping if the weather is good.

The hunters did come back later. They didn‚Äôt catch anything but while at the hut they did see a deer in the hill on the other side of the valley. They lent me their binoculars to take a better look. 

Tomorrow: Telford Campsite. Right before the infamous Linton Station slog.
