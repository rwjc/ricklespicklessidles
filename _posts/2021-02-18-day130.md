The morning was spent escaping from Longwood Forest. Miraculously I was the first one to set off.

Turnbulls Hut. It‚Äôs even more rustic and has only 2 bunks.

Last of the Longwood Forest.

It connects with Round Hill Track which is well maintained.

Historically there were large gold mining projects in this region.

On the road coming out of Round Hill, I met three super friendly dogs. 

![IMG_5252](/assets/images/20210218/img_5252.jpg)

![IMG_5256](/assets/images/20210218/img_5256.jpg)

![IMG_5260](/assets/images/20210218/img_5260.jpg)

The dark brown one even followed me on the road for about 3km. It was fun initially but it kept on walking in front of me and slowing down, or even walking in the middle of the road. The road was decently busy which meant I had to get the dog off the road every time a car comes our way. I started to get fed up. Eventually a car came and picked it up while it lagged behind. The driver then drove up to me asking if I know who the dog belonged to. I had no idea; it just followed me. So I told him where I first met the dog and he will go and drop it back there.

I got to Colac Bay. The local pub has really big burgers. It turned out that Thursday is burger day and they cost $12.50.

![IMG_5275](/assets/images/20210218/img_5275.jpg)

The others came and we had a really long lunch. We had planned this earlier so we could all have it together. 

Bus stop with charm.

The second half of the day started with a beach walk. 

![IMG_5281](/assets/images/20210218/img_5281.jpg)

![IMG_5282](/assets/images/20210218/img_5282.jpg)

![IMG_5284](/assets/images/20210218/img_5284.jpg)

Met another friendly doggo.

Looking back at the beach. 

![IMG_5295](/assets/images/20210218/img_5295.jpg)

The trail goes on farmland as well. It meanders back and forth from the farmland to the beach and vice versa.

![IMG_5297](/assets/images/20210218/img_5297.jpg)

![IMG_5303](/assets/images/20210218/img_5303.jpg)

![IMG_5305](/assets/images/20210218/img_5305.jpg)

![IMG_5313](/assets/images/20210218/img_5313.jpg)

This gave me day-1 vibes (before getting to 90 Mile Beach). Duncan had felt it too. 

![IMG_5316](/assets/images/20210218/img_5316.jpg)

I went for a swim in the south coast waters before the trail went inland . It was not cold surprisingly. The waves were huge though and very powerful. 

![IMG_5320](/assets/images/20210218/img_5320.jpg)

Bluff! It‚Äôs even closer now. 

![IMG_5325](/assets/images/20210218/img_5325.jpg)

I went over a small unnamed hill with a lookout. 

![IMG_5331](/assets/images/20210218/img_5331.jpg)

![IMG_5341](/assets/images/20210218/img_5341.jpg)

![IMG_5347](/assets/images/20210218/img_5347.jpg)

I got to Riverton. Ben is already there. Also, another group is here too. They had been in front of us but today they did a short day. Now we are merged into a mega group, maybe we will all finish together. Joe and Caleb are in their group. I met Maggie, Kieren, Leon üáøüá¶, and Raul üá™üá∏.

On the way to the supermarket we met more friendly beautiful doggie. 

![IMG_5356](/assets/images/20210218/img_5356.jpg)

![IMG_5357](/assets/images/20210218/img_5357.jpg)

![IMG_5359](/assets/images/20210218/img_5359.jpg)

![IMG_5360](/assets/images/20210218/img_5360.jpg)

Cooking non-dehydrated food is more work but much more satisfying.
