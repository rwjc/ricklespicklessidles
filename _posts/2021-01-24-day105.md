title: Day 105&#58; Two Thumb Track, Stag Saddle
description: went over two saddles today. Bullock Bow and Stag Saddle. The latter is the highest point on the offical TA trail. Pretty straightforward climbs. No tricky stuff. Took the ridge line instead of the trail. It’s really worth it.

Coming down from the saddle only to see Stag Saddle in the distance. But I’ve got a good feeling about today.

Royal Hut. There’s a story about a certain royalty who visited here when they were little. The intentions book mentioned something about the hut being the spark where Lorde wrote her hit song. I don’t know which is true.

The assault on Stag Saddle. It’s actually pretty chill.

We reached the cell service rock square. Catherine gave me a cucumber.

Team Two Thumb. Oops sorry for blocking your face Malcolm.

Going down the saddle you can either go in the valley (official route), or to the right (SOBO) go on the ridge line (which starts off higher than the highest point of the TA) with some great views.

Fun with timers. Lake Tekapo is in the background.

Camp Stream Hut is somewhere down that way. When we got there we met a French hiker, Charlotte, and a couple of young kiwi lads Joe and Caleb. I’ve heard a lot about them. They didn’t stay though. Charlotte is staying but she will leave really early to catch a shuttle that Ed and Kate had somehow arranged; so incredibly organised. They camped near the road end.

Believe it or not the water source from this hut is very far away. I somehow became the water boy. The toilet at this one is pretty bad. I won’t go into details.

All in all it was a great day. 

Ciara loves her shortcuts. I think it’s time to retire her trail name “Trail Turkey” and change it to “Shortcut Ciara”, or “Shorciara”.

Tomorrow: Tekapo
