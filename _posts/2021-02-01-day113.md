25.26km ~ 4:21 (damn that’s fast, for me)

Hāwea to Wanaka

- Hāwea River Track
- Wanaka Outlet Track

Ciara’s Kenny has offered to take our packs to Wanaka (when he’s available). So we left them at the reception and walked off with daypacks (or in someone’s case nuttin’ at all).

Goodbye Lake Hawea.

We took the track that goes along Hāwea River. But we took a shortcut, taking a page out of Shorciara’s book. We ended up having to do a dodgy river crossing over a beam.

We’ve only had a little breakfast and some of us didn’t have coffee and we’re a bit cranky.

The river was quite pleasant. At one point there is a big wave and a guy was surfing and another was kayaking. It was cool to see.

This perspective confused me. Turned out it was two hills back to back with different colours.

Some trees, grass, and a swing bridge later we arrived at Albert Town (named after Prince Albert). We went to a patisserie and finally had our coffees.

After A-Town the river (outlet, and then lake) walk to Wanaka was really nice. The water was incredibly inviting.

We came across some McMansions. The lawns were massive. This dachshund came barking all the way across and zoomed right passed us. We thought it was trying to fend off our intrusion but it just went to the lake instead without giving us a second glance.

There were some sculptures along the lake. Catherine thought it was sad because there was not another one nearby for it to chat to.

Some of us went to have some Mexican for dinner. It was a good choice. Mitch and Olaf 🇳🇿 joined us. I’ve been following them in the hut books for basically the whole TA. They are good friends doing the whole thing together.

Later we met Ciara’s p_l__m____s Kenny 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿. He is pretty cool. But he was probably a bit overwhelmed by all the questions we asked him about Ciara. We also met another old friend of hers Cody 🇨🇦 whom she worked with in a ski field once upon a time.

Oh, and I got fed up of having my unkempt moustachies in my coffee and food so I got brave and naught a razor and swiped it all off. You can clearly see the tanline on my forehead which was from the cycling days before. Not good.

Pubs and pool and some other things happened.
