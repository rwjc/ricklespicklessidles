Te Matawai Hut to Nichols Hut

13.9km ~ 7:42

People got up pretty early in the hut. So we did too. 

The group of girls doing the Duke of Edinburg is going out through Gable End (where we came from). They have an experienced hiker from the Makahika OPC as a shadow. They should have no problems going over that slip.

The day was fantastic. 

You could see Mt Ruapehu and Taranaki pretty well.

Loving it.

We climbed up along the ridge to the top of Pukematawai.

Charlotte and I reached it first. It’s the first time I hiked with her (I only briefly met her a few times in town before). She’s like a mountain goat and goes pretty fast. Sally has made her super strong.

The sign at the top.

Then everyone else came too.

A nice valley with a river. It’s very far away though. Would’ve been nice for a swim. It is getting really hot.

We were really suffering from the sun. It felt so good to get into the shade when we dropped down into the forest again.

I really like the mossy forests in the Tararuas.

We stopped by the cute orange 2-bunk Dracophyllum Hut for lunch and for some of us a little lie down. Not long before the hut we met a NOBO TA hiker Renee. She has lots of tattoos and seems really cool. She told us about the conditions ahead. There were apparently some scrambly bits which should be fun.

A bug somehow got on Charlotte’s leg. I don’t know what it is.

We met a few trail runners while we were having our leisurely lunch. They started at 4am and are planning to run the entire north-south traverse over the main ridge line. It’s 80km. They are ridiculous.

Yup that’s where we’re going.

This looks like that photo on TA’s website.

Finally we got over the hill / knob (I don’t know what the difference is. I should really find out) where we could see Nichols Hut. 

![IMG_0620](/assets/images/20201215/img_0620.jpg)

We thought there would only be Brian there. We could see a man outside the hut. I yelled out “Brian!” and more and more people came out the hut. Oops we definitely won’t all get a bunk in the hut. 

![IMG_0621](/assets/images/20201215/img_0621.jpg)

Turned out there were 7 people there already! Plus the 5 of us coming in we are obviously over the limit of the 6-bunk hut. Tahlia and I decided to camp in our tents. There is a somewhat flat area nearby for tents that can only fit 2 tents (unless you have very small tents or bivvies).

Brian was there. So nice to see him. Also Jane and Scott were there too! What a surprise. They are doing the Tararuas section northbound with another couple of TA hikers Bill and Sarah. They are from England so Genny had a nice time chatting to them about home and whatever English people like to talk about. Mark and Tania are also there, who turn out are TA hiker as well!

I tried to take a group photo in the tiny hut by putting the phone on Mark’s boot. It was kind of skewed and distorted (I tried using wide mode because I thought I wouldn’t catch everyone). With 12 people I thought I could share more of my money. But alas only Genny, Tahlia, and Brian took my offer. It’s still pretty good though. It’s about 25% left now.

Our tent site is quite cozy. But we’ve got a great view!

Brian came by to chat and to snack.

My dinner. Yum.

Charlotte also dropped by to show us some stretching routines. We talked about yoga moves and I showed her the “happy baby”. She likes that move.
