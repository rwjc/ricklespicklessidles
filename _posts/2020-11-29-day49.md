title: Day 49&#58; Side-trip mission aborted; Wet ‘n Wild to National Park
description: Weather looked bad for the next few days, I decided to continue the trail instead of doing Round The Mountain. Constant rain overloaded the track and it is wet all the way to the road.

The rain started around 5am, pretty much spot on the forecast said it would. I slept in but Round The Mountain circuit was still in my mind. After getting up, having breakfast, talking to others who were stuck because they weren’t allowing people to do the Tongariro Crossing today, and some people doing the Northern Circuit, and then the friendly people at the i-Site, I decided to do the RTM some other time. Maybe after the Whanganui Journey if the weather looks better. 

The owners of the holiday park also runs a food truck just outside - [TnT Pataka Food Truck](https://www.facebook.com/TnTPataka/). Tania and Toni are very nice and extremely helpful. I had a good chat with Tania about hiking and working by the mountains which she loves.

I got a Breakfast Burger and a coffee (for second breakfast). It was delicious.

Wet and dreary.

Before leaving I met a few boys in full rain gear walking by. They are “committed” to doing the RTM and I am slightly jealous. I wished them well. 

The Whakapapa holiday park has a drying room that contains a big fan and heater, the only one that I’ve seen so far that has this setup. It dried my tent really quickly. Very nice. 

Onwards and forwards into the wetness. Right out of the bat the siren came on. I started to go back but then it stopped. I was slightly perturbed.

I really like being out just above the tree line. Sometimes the misty views can also enhance the experience.

The track descended into the forest. Eventually the sun showed up. There had been so much rain in the last few days (including today), the track itself is overflowing with water. Luckily it’s no _too_ muddy. I soon just got used to trouncing through the middle. It was quite fun.

By now I just started prancing through the water.

After the track I walked the road to National Park (I still find it odd to be called that).

I got to the Foursquare. It has everything. I chatted with the guy in the store. He said he’s done the TA twice!! He also mentioned a 100 caves adventure in the Cook Islands that sounded terrifying.

The above reminded me of Magical Trevor:

Ah good times. 

Once again I cooked way too much.

This YHA has a climbing wall.

Since I’m not doing RTM as planned I’ll most likely go with Wayne and Vlastimil to continue the trail towards Whakahoro. Tomorrow I’ll call Karen and change my itinerary if possible.
