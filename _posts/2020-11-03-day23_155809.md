Had some rain overnight. Got out of the shed and we‚Äôre fully in mist. Contrast to yesterday‚Äôs great views, I thought today was going to be a wet day.

The problem with being the first person to walk through the bush in the morning is all the spider webs connecting across the trail at face height you‚Äôll walk into. Normally it‚Äôs a line or two which are annoying but today I bullseyed a whole complete web in the face. No.

Dome Forest wasn‚Äôt as bad as I expected. It was a bit muddy and slippery in places. I fell on my bum in one of those sections going down hill. I spent awhile fixing up my trekking poles which collapsed (but not broken) while in tension which meant it was hard to twist them back out again. A few climbs, but nothing terrible. The first section was more rugged. After the short steep forest road in the middle the trail was more pleasant (but still rooty and muddy at times).

Ominous goat just before entering the forest:

There was no rain but the dew from the night before dropped often as the wind blew by.

When the track quality suddenly becomes great unexpectedly you know you‚Äôve entered kauri territory.

At the Dome trig I turned off airplane mode and checked for messages. Paul and Nicola may come to my campsite today. Lili is not sure yet. She just climbed the Tamahunga summit and she wanted to know about the Dome Forest track. She may stay at the trail angel I was at yesterday depending on how the next section goes.

A better lookout pretty close to the normal Dome Forest entrance (my exit) from the west.

I arrived at a nice little campsite that was set up by a farmer next door, Warrick. There are some chickens and one them is all black. Look at her go!

They have a sculpture in front of the house. It looks pretty cool.

Then Heather and Locksley came to drop off some much needed resupply. She also got me a pie ü•ß and a coke ü•§! Good to see you Heath!

I‚Äôve set up my tent. Just before it started to rain some more. Good timing.
