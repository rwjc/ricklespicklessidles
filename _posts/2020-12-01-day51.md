Wayne told me yesterday that wind would pick up during the night. Oh boy he was right. It first rained, then later the wind came and brought the cold with it. It was the windiest night so far and luckily my tent didn’t blow away. 

In the morning I had a dry tent and the wind was still blowing strong. It is expected to die down with the day.

Today is all road walk (mostly gravel), but its also a cycle trail so the grade is easy. But we are getting more and more remote, and there are great scenery all along the route.

Big blue sky how I’ve missed you!

Came across a tree fall that looked very recent. It must have been a victim of the wind from last night. Will have to ask someone to clear it, otherwise the good folks at Taumarunui Canoe Hire won’t be able to deliver our canoes tomorrow. Later I found a kind farmer who had a chainsaw handy made short work of the blockage.

Due to all the rain in the last week (and more) the river is high and brown.

Kind of tempted to climb..

Happy trails!

Finally reached Whakahoro (pop. 8)

This is when you know shit just got real.

A different kind of TA but I’ll take it!

Even though it’s pretty remote here Whakahoro is quite central for a lot of outdoor adventures. Kayaking, hiking, cycling, and horse riding. There is even a cafe here which is great. Except... when I got there they are having a power cut! No coffee! No hot food! What a bummer, but I got a drink and took out some snacks to snack on. Soon Wayne and Vlastimil arrived. Also a Tour Aotearoa rider rolled in - Dave. We were all saddened about the power situation but we had a nice chat about our own journeys. Dave is on his 8th day from Cape Reinga. So fast!

While we were hanging out groups of school children (and some adults too) started to come in from the river. They are kayaking and riding along the river. Looks like the water will be busy tomorrow!

Probably the most loaded and confusing DOC sign I’ve seen.

After setting my tent up at the nearby campsite I went back to the cafe and surprise! *The power is back*. Time to throw them my money, beginning with a lasagna.

I learnt about a waterfall nearby - Blue Duck Falls - about 4km away. I had plenty of light left in the day so I took a small bag and took off. I met two ladies earlier at the cafe who did some horse riding before on the way. They told me how to get the best experience when I get to the fall. You can get to the bottom via a small side trail with ropes and slippery rocks, but you’ll need to go into the water to see the full view of the waterfall.

So. Many. Tents.
