title: Day 4&#58;  end to the seemingly endless beach; devastated
description: mostly uneventful day except great blue bird for at least half of the walk which made me drink an excessive amount of water. And the best trail magic yet!

Spent the morning chatting with Susan about her past exploits and tips for a newbie like me. She and her husband have the trail names ‚ÄúWeka and Kea‚Äù in the US (Susan is the Kea). She keeps a [trail journal](https://www.trailjournals.com/journal/12960) which I am looking forward to read up on.

I left camp late as usual. I even forgot to eat the second tasty orange Gabi offered me last night. Regret for the rest of my life.

The last leg of the 90 Mile Beach was pretty uneventful. Some obligatory beach-kill and a giant drift wood as follows:

</div>

I did come by another ambergris hunter who had one eye though. He already found some and he let me handle it. It was fairly light. He asked me to smell it. It actually does smell faintly like perfume. I wished I took a photo of it. The man said he could get $70 per gram of this stuff. Incredible.

Nothing but pictures of the nice weather, which was nice for a change. But it also meant I was a lot warmer and had to drink way more water (I almost ran out).

Finally I arrived at Ahipara. I was so glad to see it up close.

Went to stay over at the local holiday park / YHA. An American lady working there said she was stuck in NZ since February and decided to just stay and work. I asked if they sell any apples. She doesn‚Äôt have any but she just gave me an avocado ü•ë and a tomato üçÖ for free. She is awesome.

Now I have to think about how I‚Äôm going to tackle the 14km road section to Kaitaia tomorrow...
