title: Day 48&#58; A perfect day for a crossing
description: weather worries were unfounded. Pretty much the best weather I could’ve hoped for to do the Tongariro Crossing. This is balanced out by a burger truck closed before I got there, plus terrible weather in the next few days.

Tongariro to Whakapapa Village

7.5km hitch from Tongariro Holiday Park to Ketatahi car park

28.78km ~ 8:11 hiking

- Tongariro Crossing
- Mangatepopo track

I woke up to a bluebird day. I half expected it to end when I started climbing. There were a splattering a cloud and strong winds and _sleet_ (on Red Crater, they say) in the morning. But the conditions got better and better the higher I got!

The people in charge of the holiday park were very kind. They offered Fi and Sonya a ride to the northern end of the Tongariro Crossing at Ketatahi car park at 8am. I tagged along.

The start of the end. TA does this the opposite way the crossing is normally done. It means that I will go against the current. Exciting.

The first few hundred metres of the climb were in a forest. It was well maintained, as expected for a Great Walk level track.

Soon I rose above the tree line - the expanse!

After conquering the consistent climb of the switchbacks I got to North Crater. The wind chill was not trivial so I wore my gloves (for the first time on the TA) and my rain pants.

I’ve done the crossing once before, in the normal direction. But last time the Red Crater was completely clouded out, and the rest were harder to see through the fog. This time everything is way better. 

The Blue Lake!

Up until now I’ve past maybe 10 people (they must have started walking very very early). Now looking towards Red Crater from Blue Lake I see a line of people growing in clumps. The horde has arrived.

The Emerald Lakes!

You kind of stand out a bit when walking (there were also some badass trail runners weaving in and out of the walkers) the other way than everyone else. One lady recognised I was doing the TA which was nice. Others were surprised you could actually do it in that direction. I got a few jokes as well. “Did you forget something?” I laughed with them.

Red Crater. Finally got a photo of this sucker.

And of course, Mt Ngauruhoe loomed everywhere.

After the crossing I continued onto the Mangatepopo track to Whakapapa Village.

Mt Ruapehu! One day...

The Chateau in the distance.

I got to the holiday park. Dinner today:

![IMG_4304](/assets/images/20201128/img_4304.jpg)

Made a mistake in picking the camp spot. It was right beside a lamppost. It will probably be lit the whole night.

The weather forecast is not looking good. I’ll have to make some decisions tomorrow morning - whether to start the Round The Mountain circuit or forego this side trip.
