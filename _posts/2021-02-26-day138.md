Big Hellfire Hut to Freshwater Hut

Morena. You could see the sunrise from the hut! This hut is just great.

It was Alice‚Äôs birthday yesterday. Brad really wanted to catch a fish to celebrate. But the ocean was a bit hard to get to, also the wind condition meant that it was difficult. They‚Äôll have to celebrate some other way, maybe when they get back to town. Pedtra (Northern Irish lad) said he‚Äôd been getting blue cod pretty easily on the huts on the eastern side of the island. 

In the morning I climbed up onto a ridge with some views.

Looking inland towards the massive boggy swamp plains that I will be going through later (it‚Äôs pretty well boarded so it‚Äôll be easy, I hope).

There were a few of these birds singing to each other on the same tree. I wonder what they are.

I spranged my ankle again. So stupid. It always happens on nice tracks where I don‚Äôt need to focus. My mind was just wondering and I‚Äôm not looking at the ground and it just happened. That dreaded ‚Äúcrack‚Äù sound as the ankle rolls is the worst. I stopped for a bit and then hobbled along. 

Maybe it is because I slowed down or nature took pity on me I stumbled upon a group of kiwis at a corner. The first thing that I knew was the sudden kerfuffle of multiple feet stomping on the ground up ahead. They sounded really frantic so I thought it was deer. But then as I got near I saw 2 kiwis! I‚Äôm pretty sure there was a third since the bush to the left were rustling. One must have gone that way. The other two went to the right down the trail. I didn‚Äôt expect to see them again when one, bless its stupidity, ran back towards me! As it went past it stood on my shoe. I was touched by a kiwi.

I descended the ridge with renewed vigour, to Little Hellfire Beach.

To get over to Mason Bay, there‚Äôs a 300m hill in the way. I met two groups of hikers coming from Mason Bay Hut. They were flown in and had started their circuit going clockwise. This was what I initially wanted to do. But now I don‚Äôt regret at all what I‚Äôve done. 

The tide was really high when I got to Mason Bay. There‚Äôs a bit of bluff on the beach that juts out from the land where it may be impassable if large waves crash onto it. I was worried that I needed to wait for ages (hours) or do the hideous high tide route to get past it. It turned out I didn‚Äôt need to worry. It‚Äôs really short (maybe 10m at the most) and you can time it so you don‚Äôt even get wet. I got across just fine.

Mason Bay. It‚Äôs supposedly easier to spot kiwis here in the evening and dawn.

Walk the plank, and the nicely groomed grass driveway to Mason Bay Hut. No one was here when I got there.

I talked to a DOC hut warden on my way to the homestead. I‚Äôm pretty sure he is the same warden I met on Angelus Hut in Nelson Lakes probably 2 months ago. 

The track to Freshwater Hut is very flat and very easy. There were some mud but not bad at all. It‚Äôs prone to flooding though so you wouldn‚Äôt want to go after heavy rain. I met two overnight hikers having a snack break. They got a water taxi to Freshwater Hut and we‚Äôre going to Mason Bay to spend the night and hopefully look for some kiwis.

At one point you are given a choice. Which bridge would you choose?

Freshwater Hut. I‚Äôm by myself (at least at the time of this writing).

Well, except for a deer that was hanging out by the long drop. I finally got a photo of these creatures.

Unfortunately the fireplace is closed. Hut book mentioned that it doesn‚Äôt have a certified code of compliance.

Dusk glow by Freshwater River.
