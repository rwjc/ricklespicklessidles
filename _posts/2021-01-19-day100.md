For what it’s worth my 100th day was spent getting to Methven. 

And because the weather is so bad at Arthur’s Pass, the group decided to skip that section (for now) and continue from the southern side of the Rakaia River.

In the morning was breakfast at C1 again. Kate left yesterday and today Crani will too 🥲. They will fly to Wellington and wrap things up. In February they have a flight back to Canada. Sad face. Alex has gone with Linda to explore the Banks Peninsula. They have invited me and I wanted to go but it’s hard to turn down a lift back to the trail from Christchurch.

For the n-th time we went to Riverside Market again. It’s cool.

Bye bye CRANI. Thanks for the tacos and the fun.

Triple shot coffee and a pie.

Ciara played on the untuned piano and received an ovation. The people behind her didn’t seem impressed.

Tom gave us a ride all the way to Methven. So good. We stayed at the campsite there in these little cute cabins.

Here we caught up with Charlotte and Genny. Turbo Ben was also here in town. But he’s apparently in a bar using their wifi. I met Keith 🇺🇸 who is finishing up sections he missed on his TA journey last year. I also met Genny's boyfriend Richard 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿. It would be cool to hike with them. 

Malcolm and I went to Foursquare and cooked up a storm.

Charlotte came and whipped out a tub of ice cream (half full). We finished it between us in a flash.

This is a bit random (but basically half of what I write has no continuity whatsoever). I’m not going to explain how this came to be but anyway here it is. (I wasn’t even there). For your viewing pleasure.

Tomorrow: hopefully the weather isn’t too bad so we can get back on trail.
