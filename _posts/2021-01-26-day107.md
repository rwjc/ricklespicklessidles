I made breakfast. The least number of croissants in a bag I could get was 4.

We waited a bit longer for the bikes to arrive. But they did, and they came with panniers. Team Wheelies roll out!

The Tekapo canal was very exposed. The wind was super strong and always against us. The loose gravel of the roads didn‚Äôt help.

After the salmon farm there is a road section with pretty steep downhill. It was so fun.

Lake Pukaki and Mt Cook in the distance.

The kms flew by so fast when you cycle. After the canal the wind had died down so the ride was actually pretty pleasant. Sometimes it‚Äôs quite hot and dry but it‚Äôs better than slogging through the wind. We got to Twizel soon afterwards.

We dropped the bikes at the depot and picked up our packs. This was the route we took.

There were lots of us in Twizel. Most of us got an Airbnb which was really nice. Ed and Kate stayed somewhere else but we invited them over for BBQ. Ciara tried on Catherine‚Äôs dress which was cool. I think she was planning something in town. She made an incredible salad. Charlotte made a very nice potato salad.

Chief (Keith) manned the BBQ and it caught on fire. But he did a really good job.

Later on in the night was more of a blur. I remember missing out on ice cream. I hope there are still some left.
