Final little hike to shakedown the gear at [Tunnel Point campsite](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/parks-recreation/stay-at-park/Pages/accommodation-details.aspx?itemID=101) on the west coast. Even a little bit of beach walk as a sneak peek of the 90 Mile Beach.

I guess now it‚Äôs obvious why it‚Äôs called that.

In the end I didn't drop that many things. But it was good to go over everyhing again, including trying to create this post while out which I've never done before.
