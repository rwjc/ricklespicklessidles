Sandy Bay to Ngunguru 

21.4km ~ 5:37

Woke up to the sound of waves (what a nice feeling).

Breakfast and beer. What could go wrong?

I cleaned up as per instructions (I’m pretty sure I turned off the toilet water tank valve...) and set off from the beach.

The road detour ends with a cycle trail through the Bush. Not as bad as I thought.

Straight, no gunk in it.

Is it just me...?

I don’t have a degree in vegetology but I don’t think those are sunflowers.

Not long after I arrived at Ngunguru. They have a lovely cafe and a store. I had a thickshake, a mussel fritter, and a lamb & kumara pie. And then a coffee! Best coffee on trail so far.

A full pie cabinet is a thing to behold.

I had arranged a boat with James at Nikau Bay eco-camp across the river at 2pm the night before, but I got there a bit early.  So I had some snacks and walked around and found a wee estuary track which was not on the trail app but it strangely has the TA markers anyway. Maybe it was on the trail in years past. So I walked it.

An old lady on a scooter zoomed past me three times while I was there walking around, each time turning her head to smile at me. She must enjoyed going faster than someone else.

When I went back to the boat ramp I found Nicola! Haven’t seen her since Kerikeri. What a pleasant surprise.

We went out to the edge of the water to get onto the boat since it was low tide.

The Nikau Bay eco-camp is super nice. The common room is nice and big. They also have a hammock, trampoline, swings, and lots of nice grassy areas to camp.

We had a good long lazy afternoon chilling in the hammocks. I even took a nap. It was great.

I was deciding whether to camp or get a cabin bed. Then clouds started to congregate and a few small drizzles appeared which made my decision for me.

Later in the afternoon it started to pour down. That’s when James went out to get more hikers. It was Lili and Paul (from Tokoroa)! Stream dream team reunion!

Then Wendy and James came at the perfect time with fresh eggs and veges from the garden for us to add to our dinners.

James sat us down on a long school classroom bench to teach us about the day ahead. There are 2 rivers which we will wade through tomorrow. Horahora River and Taiharuru River. He briefed us on the best timing and how to tackle them each. It was very detailed. Ask him about the rivalry between Blair and Peter for the water taxi service across the Whangarei Harbour. Its a good laugh.

Tomorrow we will try and get to Ocean Beach camp just before Bream Head. Should be a long day. Can’t lounge around too much and not get anything done. Gotta be somewhere!
