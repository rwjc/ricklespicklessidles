Yankee River Hut to East Ruggedy Hut

Today rained all day. On the upside though I saw 2 kiwis! In the wild! For the first time! I’m so happy. 

I had got a waterproof case for my phone. But the lens cover tend to fog up anyway. That’s why the photos are a bit wonky. 

Another 3-wire bridge. My second. It’s just as fun as my first.

Smoky Beach.

To get to the beach I needed to climb up this short, steep, but surprisingly difficult sandy hill.

River crossing at Smoky Creek. The tide is coming in so it was getting deeper. But it’s still manageable.

Some coastal scenes. They would’ve been much better had the weather been great I’m sure.

I had a break at Long Harry Hut. I met a couple here. Linn 🇸🇪  and Alex 🇮🇹. It turned out they are doing the South Island TA. They had started from Ship Cove (Queen Charlotte) and got down to Arthur’s Pass. Now they flip flopped and will start from Bluff and work their way northbound after they’ve done the North West Circuit. 

Long Harry Hut is very nice. I even got good signal. I was really tempted to just stay here for the night to wait out the rain. But a COWI lady came in and told us that rainy conditions are good for spotting kiwis; and she has seen 4 today! I decided to push on into the wet.

And celebrate. I did see kiwis. So good. 

This one could be a totoro.

Not the best photo.

It’s shy.

There’s a rocky beach that we had to boulder hop for ages.

Sea intestines.

The Rugged Islands.

Back on the beach and sand dunes of East Ruggedy Beach.

East Ruggedy Hut. Very nice too (actually all the huts on Stewart Island had been great). One of the busiest nights so far. I met the three French troupe I met back in McKellar Hut (Greenstone) and then again at Invercargill - I got the name of one of them - Joe 🇫🇷 (unfortunately there’s no hut book here for me to be sneaky and check up on their names). They are doing it COWI so we exchanged track information. Linn and Alex are here as well. There are two others I haven’t got the names yet - a kiwi and a(mother) lad from Ireland.
