Morning! Really misty in the morning. Tent is condensationed.

Almost all the tracks through Linton Station is 4WD. There are some hills that they route you through but they are totally fine. The weather was fine for us as well. Not hot and quite chill. Didn‚Äôt need to carry much water.

Down into the paddocks. Waikato vibes.

Into Birchwood station.

The hut in the station is quite nice. Sarah and Dean has done a good job. When Ben and I got here there was a NOBO here - Mitch from Raglan. The fire was on. It was great. 

We had originally arranged a home cooked meal at Birchwood. But because there were so many of us and that they had 7000 sheep to shear, they couldn‚Äôt give us all a meal. (Debbie somehow got one). The rest of us got a courtesy van from a local pub (in Wairio) to have dinner there. 

Debbie‚Äôs homemade curry.

Our table is reserved. Feeling fancy.
