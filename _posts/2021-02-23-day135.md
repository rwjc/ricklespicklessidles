Morena.

This morning rained, but not too hard. Carry onwards on the North West Circuit.

There are surprisingly numerous board walks.

A piwakawaka followed me for a long time. I must have been kicking up a lot of insects as I walk. 

I had lunch at Christmas Village Hut. It’s a very nice hut.

The circle of life. Although the bumblebee had no problem getting out of this pickle. I suppose in this case the circle is broken. There are lots of bumblebees at the huts actually. It’s comparable to Nelson Lakes.

Alice and Brad came as I was about to leave. We had originally planned to stay here but we got there quite early so all of us decided to push on to the next. 

Roots! Bloody roots!

I’m feeling lucky.

Windswept.

There are lots of big Rimu along this stretch.

Yankee River Hut. It’s also great. It’s next to a river _and_ the sea. One cool thing about the huts on Stewart Island is that they are all close to the ocean. At night you will fall asleep with the sound of waves (and maybe shrieks of kiwis).

There are also a dart board and darts.

At the hut I met three lady nurses from Whangarei - Bobbie, Beth, and Sarah. I asked them about chafing and they recommended 3B cream - for (between and beneath the) breasts, buttocks, and legs; and any other crevasses you may have.
