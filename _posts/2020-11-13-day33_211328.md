The Hakarimata Ranges to [The Tron](https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/39kit2/comment/cs4gbwa)

33.3km ~ 8:47

There were more possum activity early in the night. I have gotten used to them. I had a great sleep. 

In the morning we continued on to finish off the Hakarimata and came down the other side with lots and lots of steps. There were also about 40 people doing their Friday morning summit run/walk. People were getting out there! The summit was a helipad and a raised platform, with neat views.

Running (more slow jog) down the steps was quite fun. Especially when going past people coming up huffing and puffing.

The riverside walk from Ngaruawahia was lovely.

I decided to go to a bakery. Just as I was about to pay, I could not find my wallet. Panic stations! Calming myself down, I sifted through my memory on possible places where I may have left/dropped it. Either a stump in a park right after coming into town, or... all the way up on Hakarimata summit. On my way to the stump I met the others (Lili, Scott, and Jane) and told them about my mishap. They were so nice, offering to lend me some cash. I told them I‚Äôm going to retrace my steps. They will wait for me outside New World. I went to the stump. Luckily it was (still) there! Happy days. 

On my way back to meet them I saw an Apple Maps car.

Since I wasn‚Äôt successful at the bakery before, I decided to go to this cute cafe to get a coffee. 

![IMG_3241](/assets/images/20201113/img_3241.jpg)

I chatted with a guy while waiting for my coffee. It never bores me telling people about the TA. He was genuinely interested as well. 

Coming out of the cafe with my cup of coffee, I heard these magical words:

<blockquote><small>‚ÄùAre you hungry, bro?‚Äù</small></blockquote>

I turned around, and two Maori ladies and a lightly touched plate of what looked like a typical ‚Äúbig breakfast‚Äù meal were looking at me. Turned out they had enough to eat and saw me (probably looking scruffy and underfed), so they asked me if I wanted some. Of course you wonderful people!

![IMG_3242](/assets/images/20201113/img_3242.jpg)

They were Momo and Tahe-something (sorry I couldn‚Äôt recall üò≠ I‚Äôm terrible). We had a nice chat. They told me about Maori politics (which Momo assured me is worse than ‚Äúnormal‚Äù politics). They have a meeting at the marae tomorrow where they will vote on the leaders and issues of the trust. She said that ‚Äúthere are too many chiefs, and not enough indians‚Äù, and gave me a wink.

If I hadn‚Äôt temporarily lost my wallet I wouldn‚Äôt have met them. Odd how things turn out sometimes. 

Because of this I was late to meet the others. I told them about what happened and they thought it was a great story, so they forgave me. 

We set off to continue the riverside walk all the way to Hamilton. While it is not road walking it is all on pavement, and crossing the river a few times.

I haven‚Äôt had much chance to hang out with animals lately but here‚Äôs a small horse (we were not sure why it wouldn‚Äôt move into the shade) and some dogs while we were resting by the river.

Once we got to Hamilton we parted ways. Lili is being picked up by her future sister in law üòâ, Scott and Jane will continue their luxurious ways and go to a motel. The Gang of Four lasted one full day.

I had dinner at Joe‚Äôs garage (didn‚Äôt realize they had one in Hamilton). Salmon + chips + beer + cheesecake.

For tonight‚Äôs accomodation I am staying at a trail angels up in the suburb of Flagstaff. I caught the bus yay.

![IMG_3267](/assets/images/20201113/img_3267.jpg)

There‚Äôs a fancy new countdown that‚Äôs opened up near their home. I will resupply there tomorrow. 

Trail angel Chris did the TA in 2015 while he was at university. He had a poster of Aotearoa with stickers at where he camped each night. We had a great chat about his experience and what I‚Äôve done so far. I asked him about the difficult parts - Tararuas, Richmond ranges, Waiau Pass, etc. it was fun talking about it all. He probed about river crossings among other things. He wanted to see how prepare I was. He said in past years there were some people coming to stay with him who were very unprepared. Glad to hear he thinks I‚Äôm okay. 

This is Billy:

Today was a long day. Tomorrow will be shorter. I haven‚Äôt decided yet where to stay. Either at The Backyard Bar in Whatawhata which everyone raves about (but is only 12km away); or at a trail angels place a little further (18km). I will have to decide tomorrow.
