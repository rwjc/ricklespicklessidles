Morning was misty and _fresh_.

Hawksbay Paul went out quite early without even telling us. How rude. Ciara and I took off next. We said bye to everyone else.

Continuing with similar scenes from yesterday the big valleys and river crossings are abundant today.

Refreshing face wash. So convenient.

On the other side of the river is a ‚Äúcarpark‚Äù. There were people there yelling and lots of smoke appeared. I assumed they were burning stuff.

The trail turned into a 4WD track with lots of flowers along the way.

We took a break on the meadow in the sun and Ciara had a brief moment of zen.

The track joined up with St James Walkway and we will be on it all the way to Boyle. We met some hikers on this trail. It‚Äôs easy going and the weather was fine. 

At Anne Hut I bumped into Robin, whom I met at St Arnaud. She was hiking with another. In the hut was also Michael üá≥üáø. He had the reputation of eating sandflies. Source of protein I guess. 

We decided to push on to the next good hut. Which would make this the longest (in terms of distance) day I‚Äôve hiked. But it‚Äôs easy grade tramping track so we weren‚Äôt worried. 

There was a little bump we needed to go over to get down to a different valley. Anne Saddle.

For the last few miles we put on our respective earbuds and listened to whatever helped us go further. Mine was post-rock.

At last we arrived at Boyle Flat Hut.

It‚Äôs a lovely hut. The only downside is that the faucet on the water tank is _still_ broken so you need to get water from the river which has a little hill between it and the hut. 

There was only one person in the hut! Deborah üá´üá∑ is hiking from Lewis Pass and is doing a loop. Ciara tried to sell her the idea of Blue Lake and Waiau Pass. Not sure if she succeeded. 

Hawksbay Paul arrived soon after. But Malcolm and Tokoroa Paul didn‚Äôt. We assumed they wanted to chill. 

Tomorrow: Boyle and maybe even Hanmer Springs.
