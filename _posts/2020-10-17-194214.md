Mangamuka route campsite to Makene Road campsite

21.88km ~ 8:47

So the stories about this track is not unwarranted. It‚Äôs tough, it‚Äôs muddy, it‚Äôs long, it‚Äôs also rewarding at the end.

I think Simon and I had quite a good day though. The conditions are really good. The forest is really chill so we didn‚Äôt overheat easily. Climbing the peaks definitely made us sweat profusely. But it was easy to cool off. We ended up with a very reasonable time from camp to camp.

For walkers who might be interested, it took me about 7 hours 30 minutes to get out of the forest itself onto the farm.

There‚Äôs no water on the track at all. So we carried lots. I had about 3.3 litres. At the end I was left about 500ml. If the day was a lot more humid or hotter I would‚Äôve struggled.

My face would not look like that while I‚Äôm trying to pull myself up the climbs but once at the top with at last some view to look at it was worth it (I think).

I‚Äôve not agreed with a sign more (except maybe the jazz apple bit. Braeburn is the way to go üçé).

Walkers will see these blue km markers along the way. They seem so far apart since it‚Äôs so slow going. FYI Raetea summit is at 8 and after about 12 the mud dies down a lot. There‚Äôs a magical section between I think 13 and 16 with a lovely grassy 4WD track (but nice things never last üòü).

After the forest I arrive at the working farm that is quite friendly to hikers (except their farm dogs who howled endlessly).

I then came to a caravan as I was about to go over a stile. A lady was walking around the vehicle and she looked like she was going to take her top off. I quickly yelled out to make sure she knows I‚Äôm here. Turns out she is not living at the farm but in a supporting capacity for her partner Mark who is apparently doing the same section we were doing today. Her name is Cindy and she‚Äôs from Belgium. Mark is Dutch and I‚Äôve heard about his shinanigans from Simon. He started a bit late and Cindi is looking to hike up from the end to meet him and bring him water. Before that we had a good chat and she offered me a banana. Trail angels are the best. A little girl named Darcy who lives there also came to chat. She also helped us fill our water bottles which was super sweet. I offered her some snake lollies but she refused. Later at camp we realized that probably was quite sketchy since parents always tell children to not trust people who offer them sweets. If a cop comes by tomorrow at least I‚Äôll get a lift to town!

Campsite was 500m down from the farm and it‚Äôs next to a nice little stream. I cooled my tired and banged up feet in its sweet chilling waters and enjoyed some company with a new TA hiker Lili. She camped on the summit last night so today she strolled down with a few other girls who decided to continue on while Lili stayed behind and chilled. Unfortunately her pad has a leak. We took ages with soapy-ish water and a bucket of water from the stream but we couldn‚Äôt find it. I suggested she go up to the farm next morning to borrow some detergent and a bath tub and she thought it was the best way to go.

Tomorrow there will be more road walks. But I‚Äôll going to take it easy. They‚Äôll be another Forest coming up which should be fun. It‚Äôs going to be a wet one.

Gutted the Mangamuka Dairy will be closed tomorrow. Otherwise I could‚Äôve got some resupplies and an ice cream!
