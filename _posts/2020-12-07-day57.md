Whakahoro to Whanganui 

150km ~ 5 days paddling

6km road walking

// TODO: insert mega Topo-gpx of the whole 156km route to Whanganui

I have broken my streak of a-post-a-day diary‚Äîbefore-bed-athon. It‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm lazy or anything. I wasn‚Äôt able to because my phone politely but repeatedly refused to turn on. Now I‚Äôm on a new phone, while being significantly poorer than before (but _rich_ in experiences). This will be a post with minimal (good) photos unfortunately. There are still some photos and videos taken from my GoPro (thank goodness I also brought it). But the quality is on the whole even more shocking than my usual photography since I‚Äôm not even a pro.

Tldr, I fell in the river, stuck in an eddy, a kind man nudged me to the shore, gave me lunch, and my phone died. Now I‚Äôm in Whanganui (the town) enjoying its hospitality. 

I will try and recall what happened each day during the time-skip. 

## Day 52: Whakahoro to John Coull Campsite

(I actually have written a post at the end of this day, with lots of photos. Since the incident happened on the second day on the water. It currently on my old dead phone. Maybe once I get it fixed I could resurrect the post and the photos I have before then)

First day of paddling. But we had lots of time in the morning to get ready. The nice people from Taumarunui Canoe Hire will come at about 9:30am to get us sorted. 

The night before was chaotic. Not us mind you, it‚Äôs the two hordes of school children on their outdoor adventure field trip. They were so loud! At one point some were playing hide and seek, and one boy tried to hid behind my tent while I was in it trying to rest. Outrageous I say. At least their guardian made all of them go to bed at 10pm, which was way later than my trail bedtime. In the morning one school group went into the river fairly early. The other group seemed to be going on the mountain bikes today. 

We moseyed up towards the Blue Duck Cafe just when they about to open for the day, hoping for some coffee before we head off into the wild in the next 4 days. Mel opened the door, and she apologised about the power being down again! Unbelievable! She was joking though and I almost fell for it. So cheeky. 

Photos of my amazing breakfast will have to wait for when I get my old phone fixed though. 

Ben from TCH rolled into town in a van with a trailer full of canoes and a kayak. I guess the kayak is for me. There were many others in the van. They are people going to canoe to Pipiriki, the usual place to head back to land. Us silly TA hikers normally continue onwards to the Whanganui city fringe. Karen makes bread and muffins for us. It was very nice; a little sugar rush before going into the water. 

The river levels are still high and pretty brown. It wasn‚Äôt long before we got used to our vehicles and were on our way. We started on a side stream for about 500m and then we were spit into the wide and flowing Whanganui River.

The rapids (it would have been accurate had the river been low) were no issues.

At one point we got together in the middle of the river and shared some beers. I later found out we weren‚Äôt really supposed to do that, apparently I missed that part in the briefing. But we only had one each. It felt great not gonna lie.

On the day it felt it took forever to get to the campsite. But now, writing after the whole journey ended, I realised those were noob talk. Little did I know then we had two big days at the end (50km each and 8 hours paddling). 

John Coull campsite is DOC run. The first time landing we experienced what will probably the most intense physical activity everyday on the river - hauling our massive barrels up to camp. Since the river can potentially rise so high all the camps and lodges are much much higher up. We all need multiple trips. But we all help each other though. Go team! For the three of us we have 2 large barrels for our packs and things that we don‚Äôt mind getting wet (they aren‚Äôt fully sealed for some reason), and 6 smaller barrels for everything else - including beers and food. 

There is also a fancy hut. I hate to generalise but it seems that people who stay there are generally older... richer.... more successful.... probably. Great Walk hut prices are no joke. 

I did meet many awesome people though, both tenting and hutting (is that even a word). Trevor (Nelson) and Collin (Tauranga) are good friends and they have incredible sense of humour. Levon and Maggie (environmental researchers from the US working in Milford Sound) are quite adventurous and fun to chat to. Pip and Maia - mother daughter power duo who have already walked across the country in different ways with a love of the land that is contagious. Maia told us later that next time she wants to go about traversing New Zealand on a horse üèá. You go girl! There was also another Rick. He‚Äôs much taller than me. 

The ranger Rene told us that the group of school kids were supposed to stay here too. It would be absolutely bonkers since there‚Äôs no way we could have all fit there, especially with this massive tents. Luckily they informed the ranger that they ‚Äúknew some guy‚Äù a little bit downriver who is part of a marae and they will go there tonight instead. Thanks some guy!


## Day 53: John Coull Campsite to Joe‚Äôs Place (Ramanui)

It rained overnight. It continued to drizzle in the morning. We found out later that Maggie has a knack of making the weather turn great whenever she‚Äôs in the water. Too bad for us she isn‚Äôt going all the way to Bluff...

We packed up and slowly put things into our respective barrels (instead of our packs) and made our way down back to our canoes and kayak. 

Not long we got in the water we heard an armada of blue canoes coming up behind us. It‚Äôs the school kids. They have a few adult guides and the soon caught up to us. A Maori guide in the front announced to the kids ‚Äúswallow them up‚Äù. And they swarmed us. Then he found out two of us were from Auckland. Then it really started going off. Our canoes got a bit cozy and were bumping into another slightly. It was fun.

The Maori guide has been doing this awhile and he knows about the history of many coves and places of interest along the river. He invited us to tag along into a small narrow side stream with high cliffs on either side where he will tell us a story. It was about a conflict between lower and upper river tribes. One fateful day where one tribe devised a cunning plan to strike a heavy blow to another. It was in this canyon, where they unleashed their weapon - a beautiful naked lady, daughter of the chief. She was inside on side of the stream, where the warriors floating by from the river could still see. History has taught us that anything beautiful and naked and looks too good to be true you should probably stay away. But on that day it worked. Warriors of the invading tribe were lured in, where the defending warriors (including men, women, and children) were up above both sides of the cliffs throwing down rocks and whatnot onto the poor horny souls. It is said that the river ran red, and there probably was a party afterwards (unconfirmed).

The next part is the infamous Bridge to Nowhere. It‚Äôs a place where hopeful settlers settled and then had to unsettle. After clearing the surrounding native bush, building all sorts of things, including a bridge, it turned out it was not viable to live there. So the people left. At the initial briefing by Ron at their home base we were shown a old photo of two guys lifting a piano with fences that were very new visibly in the foreground. It was also at this point where I had the incident. 

I wasn‚Äôt even paddling. We got to the landing that connects to a track to the Bridge to Nowhere. There was also a jet boat already parked there. We tied our canoes to a pole. It was upstream of the boat. The current was pushing us towards the boat. We don‚Äôt want to scratch the paint on the boat so we were going to untie and manoeuvre around and to the downstream of the boat. Wayne got his canoe around. But when it was my turn, another jet boat came up the river going the speed they normally go and went by. We had been briefed about how to deal the wake the boat creates, but i was about to hop off, even though I tried to sit back down and control the kayak, the wake pushed me against the moored boat and it just flipped me. It all happened really fast. 

The river was cool and refreshing. We all have life jackets, and I hung onto my paddle and the kayak. The goal is to float down the river and try and get to a beach or a side stream further down. The owner of the moored boat was there by the landing. He shouted that there is a stream I could get into in about 200m. I acknowledged and I was calm. As I tried to push towards the side with my feet, I were caught by the current. It was a strong eddy. It pushed me back upstream and towards the cliff side (it still has some rocks and vegetation I thought I could grab onto), but as I got close the current would bounce away from the cliff and pushed me back to the river again. I tried many time to try and get to the side, or escape by trying to go further downstream, I couldn‚Äôt. I was stuck. Going in circles. I was starting to get cold and started to panic. Maybe this is how I will go. I tried to calm myself down. 

Rob (I later found out) got into his boat and moved towards me to try and help me get out. We tried various things - him nudging the kayak as best he could, asking me to grab onto a railing on this boat. I actually forgot what we did in the end, because we tried a lot of things that didn‚Äôt work. Even though he was moving slowly (for him), his motor and the blades felt so close to me that I was constantly terrified. There were ropes attached to the kayak (for tying things down) that I imagined would be flowing freely in the water. I was afraid it would get tangled in the blades and somehow I would get tangled as well. That didn‚Äôt happen. We somehow made it to the side stream, where other canoes and boats were parked. The track to the bridge also connects to here. It‚Äôs a much better place to land. It took me a long time to climb up to the bank. I was so cold. I took of my wet clothiers, tried to wring as much water as I can can wore them again. It was fortunate that the sun was out. I was still shivering. Rob must have saw more miserable I was he offered me a sandwich which was part of his lunch (he had two big sandwiches) to help me warm up. He saved me again. I could not thank him enough.

(This was after I walked to see the bridge and came back, when the school kids came in. They had no idea what happened to me)

I found out my phone had died. It wouldn‚Äôt turn on. I had put in a zipped up pocket of my jacket, that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt lose it completely. I had faint hopes that I would somehow resurrect it with some power and some love. (I was wrong)

I still have my GoPro though. But I wasn‚Äôt really thinking about taking photos. My mind was shook. I hoped I will see Wayne and Vlastimil as I walked to the bridge. 

![](/assets/images/20201207/125807.jpg)

There‚Äôs a lookout that was 2 minute away from the track that gives you a much better view of the bridge. I didn‚Äôt even go to it (I normally would be excited to go off to a lookout hoping for a good view). It‚Äôs not my best day. 

One funny thing I remember though was while I was floating down the river hanging onto dear life, several more jet boats skimmed across - carrying tourists to see the Bridge to Nowhere no doubt. They waved at me and some even took their cameras out! I‚Äôm glad I could be of some comedic service. I did wave back but I felt conflicted. 

I met a bunch of people at a picnic table at the end of the bridge. They were on a guided tour. Their guides had carried snacks and tea in vacuum flasks for them. They look so good. Soon after a different school group got there and it got pretty busy. Brian had told me earlier that he saw big eels in the river below the bridge. It was still too brown for me to see anything. I left quickly. Before the bridge got too swamped with bodies. 

I met Wayne on the way back. He was glad I was okay. They all saw me floating down the river. We agreed that I would wait for them at the side stream entrance. We regrouped and then we continued to the next camp - Joe‚Äôs Place / Ramanui. There is a DOC campsite Tieke on the other side of the river. The two groups of school kids are staying separately so we each get one group. Luckily we got there early and had a choice to place our tents as far away from the school group as possible. The ones arriving later didn‚Äôt have that luxury. Trev and Collin got a cabin so they aren‚Äôt affected by them.

When we landed, Darrel came down with his quad bike and helped us bring all of our barrels up. Such a champ! Saved us so much time and energy. 

Beside the campsite there is a lodge. It is really nice. There‚Äôs even a bar! We all ended up there at some point and had a grand old time. I found out more about Wayne‚Äôs competitive paragliding background. He had a bad crash in the Coromandels and had damaged one of his vertibrae. He took a long time to recuperate and eventually he could walk on his legs. It was the main reason for him to do the TA. It is an incredibly inspiring story. 

Maggie also had experience paragliding. Levon planned it for her birthday. But the lift off didn‚Äôt go quite right for her and she ended up breaking her arm (not realising it at the time). She had some obstacles while Levon was up in the air having all the fun. We joked that he planned this birthday for himself.

Trev got his hands on a guitar. We were all eager with great anticipation. He had a very good and dramatic intro with spoken word - about a jailed man looking through bars at the moon. Then... it got lewd. It was pretty hilarious but we all had some to drink so it went down quite well. 

Pip used to be a psychologist and started to whip out her psychoanalysis toolbox (not in a creepy way). She has a good relationship with Maia. To be honest I don‚Äôt quite remembered what happened but it was a much needed gathering for me to get over what had happened earlier. 

## Day 54: Joe‚Äôs Place (Ramanui) to Flying Fox

This was a long day - about 51km paddling. Today I switched with Vlastimil. I went on the canoe and he got the kayak. 

It was harder to manoeuvre than the kayak, but having two people mean that it‚Äôs easier to go faster and keep the momentum going.

We got to a big cave by the river. The river is slightly lower (and slower) now. The water is also (ever so slightly) less brown.

Before lunchtime we got to the landing at Pipiriki. Many others were here already, waiting for their ride out back to civilisation. We took a break here. There was even a French couple I met only on the first day. They had decided to do their own thing and stay at less crowded campsites. Trev offered us to go find him when we‚Äôre in Nelson. I might do just that when I finish the Queen Charlotte track! There was also a English couple there who were playing connect 4 the night before at the lodge and we being silly tipsy adolescents making bets on who would win. After some chats we bid them farewell and continued on. 

After some hard paddling we got to Flying Fox, called that probably because there is a powered cable car across the river. We later found out there are more of these down river. This place isn‚Äôt marked on the maps provided by the TCH. It was interesting trying to localize what we were seeing and what‚Äôs on the drawn map. Eventually we pulled over on a bank so Wayne to get out his phone and check where we were and how long we still had to go. Surprise it was only 3km away!

The owners Kelly and Jane are very friendly. Their place I really nice. Lots of fruit trees, hot bush shower, loads of campsites, interesting architecture, and friendly chickens.

Wayne said he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt realise Vlastimil is such a chick magnet‚Äù.

Camping beneath a mature avocado tree with lots of fruits!

There is a place called Jerusalem not long after Pipiriki. It‚Äôs a settlement with a nunnery. Pip and Maia planned to stay there so I wasn‚Äôt expecting to see them at Flying Fox. They arrived later in the day. Apparently the people at Jerusalem wasn‚Äôt too friendly to people who come down on the river. Karen had told us that as well. It‚Äôs unfortunate. 

I met a lady Lisa who was also part of a group (with the other Rick) with similar itinerary as us. She was great to chat to. She is from Wellington and invited me to come and stay if I need to. How nice!

## Day 55: Flying Fox to Whanganui Top 10

In the morning Jane offered to make us some BLT and a coffee. How could I say no?

![](/assets/images/20201207/082243.jpg)

Maia is very good with animals. She also likes _doof doof_ parties.

![](/assets/images/20201207/082410.jpg)

I really should have realized the GoPro ‚Äúwide‚Äù photo mode int what I should be using. 

![](/assets/images/20201207/090841.jpg)

Another big day. Originally we had planned to go to Hipango Park, a free campsite managed by Whanganui district council. But due to tides and the fact that we had enough time we pushed on instead. I met a South African lady with two Canadians at the park where we took a break. She used to live in Auckland but is now a gardener and landscaper in Whanganui. Her friend had a boat and it is it‚Äôs second voyage and they were taking it out for a spin. 

The last few kms to the holiday park were tough. The river is now very wide and the water is very calm (until the wind and rain picked up). Eventually we got there though. It was a 53km day. 

The rain started pouring down heavily. We put our tent up in it. And just for laughs once we were done the rain stopped and the sun came out.

Usually the holiday park has special rates cabins for TA hikers but alas it‚Äôs Saturday and there is a kids rowing competition going on this weekend. So they‚Äôve booked all the cabins. That‚Äôs why we were camping. Ah well. I found out there about about 60 kids and support crew. They are from Wellington. It is better to train here on these calm river water, as opposed to Wellington which is anything but. 

My kind of sign.

## Day 56: Whanganui Top 10 Holiday Park to Whanganui 

My plan for today is to do a near-zero (nero) day and get my phone fixed in town. This means I will end up by myself will others go on. Our adventures together come to an end (for now). 

![GPTempDownload](/assets/images/20201207/084443.jpg)

There was a petrolheae convention with lots of muscle cars. I got in the way.

2B or 1H

![GPTempDownload](/assets/images/20201207/094154.jpg)

Harking back to times without a phone. Using a paper map to mark down (with a pen) where things are by using a computer at the library. 

![GPTempDownload](/assets/images/20201207/113508.jpg)

Since it‚Äôs Sunday all the repair shops are closed. I will visit them tomorrow. I found a hostel where I got a private room. 

## Day 57: Whanganui 

Today is a zero day. For taking care of business. I went into town to be a tourist, visit places, and try and get my phone fixed.

I quite like the Main Street. There are nice riverside walkways which reminded me of Hamilton and Kerikeri.

The Lion.

![GPTempDownload](/assets/images/20201207/103726.jpg)

I spent some time at the local museum. There were some neat stuff there (I especially loved the taxidermy exhibitions). Then there is this bit which I find very creepy (dolls are my weakness).

Back at the hostel. Feeling better. 

![IMG_0010](/assets/images/20201207/180944.jpg)

I hadn‚Äôt got my old phone fixed yet. I got a new one. But I have reasons to get the old one up and running again. It‚Äôs a long story and it‚Äôs probably pretty boring. 

Whanganui or Wanganui. Damn right. So many inconsistencies everywhere I look in town. That‚Äôs what happens when the council tries to change the name after it had been well established for yonks.

![IMG_0011](/assets/images/20201207/img_0011.jpg)

It‚Äôs so late right now. 

Tomorrow I‚Äôm not sure whom yet what‚Äôs going to happen.
