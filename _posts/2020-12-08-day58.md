Whanganui to Koitiata 

38.3km ~ 7:30 (including about 7km hitch)

I checked out the hostel (42b College House by the way is pretty chill and great facilities and the German owners are top notch!) and went to a shop to send my old phone away to get fixed. The owner of that place - Kiwi Tech - Blair had been incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. Once it’s returned I’ll either hitch or bus back to grab it. 

First attraction of the day - Durie Hill Elevator. 

You could either walk up 300 or so steps,

Or, take an old-timey elevator via a long tunnel.

View over the city is pretty nice at the top. Would’ve been even better with some sun!

After Durie I faced a pretty long road walk to the next camp at Koitiata. What’s worse it started to rain heavily. I passed a dairy and ate a hot pie (such an important instant happiness in a bag) then started putting my legs and feet to some tough love which I haven’t had to do since of all the paddling on the Whanganui River. 

The rain came and left repeatedly, switching between light drizzle and gale-like sidewinder to the face. I used the umbrella whenever I could when the wind dies down. It just feels a lot more comfortable if the drops are not constantly hitting the head and the shoulders. 

When I got to SH3 a big jeep pulled up in front of me. The driver offered me a lift since I probably looked positively miserable. Bevan is from Whanganui and was going to Wellington to see his daughter and 1 year old grand son. He had experienced some tough times in the past and had a change in perspective in life. He began to help people whenever he can. I gladly accepted his offer and he took me down the road to Turakina. 

The TA is supposed to turn off earlier and head towards the ocean (west coast we meet again!). Then the trail turns southward along the coast and a possibly gnarly river crossing of the Turakina River needs to be done near low tide. I couldn’t get the low tide timing today. Also it had been raining all day so I wasn’t too keen on heading to the river with the risk of having to back track and do the road detour. 

At Turakina there’s a cafe (I didn’t visit it though). I bought another pie at the gas station and head off on the last bit of road. Then soon the rain disappeared and the sun was out.

The little town of Koitiata has some charm.

I went to the local campground. It runs on the honesty system.

Tomorrow I will head to Bulls and stay at a trail angels place. Brian highly recommended them and apparently Tahlia is with them today. Not sure if she will still be there tomorrow but I hear there’s a great spa! It’s not to be missed!
