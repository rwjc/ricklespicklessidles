Mairangi Bay to Devonport

9.74km ~ 2:45

In the morning Jess made bacon and eggs. It was pretty good.

I was dropped off at Mairangi Bay, where some sort of family beach event was about to be kicked off. The beach was packed with people and more were pouring in. 

I started walking the coastal trail. It was slightly late so the tides started to come in. There’s nothing like rock hopping in the morning to warm up the ankles and the heart.

My mate Jason and his son Ico came to have brunch with me at a cafe in Castor Bay. By the time I got to Campbells Bay the tides had come in far enough to made the last bit of rocks to be too risky for me to cross. So I went back and went up a tall staircase where a bunch of mostly topless people were training to be better at running up and down stairs.

At lunch time I met up with Freya in Takapuna for some nice and healthy salads.

While in Takapuna Beach I contacted Lili who happened to be in he Takapuna Beach Cafe chilling. We were fairly close but we didn’t meet up. I was going to see Marcelo and Masha who joined me for more food and drinks. I am planning to go to stay Lili’s  in a couple of days. Hopefully I’ll see her then.

At the end of the day I got a ride to Tiffany and Iain who are trail angels in Devonport. They are incredibly hospitable and their house is so amazing I was in awe. 

Archy and I were waiting patiently with some expertly cooked snapper (which Tiffany caught a day ago!) and scotch fillet steak.

Two of their sons were also in. Their family is full of elite athletes who excel in running, cycling, volleyball (*prem* level) and I’m sure many others. One of them is even on a track and field scholarship in a college in Idaho, USA which is really impressive. Tiffany and Iain are planning to do the TA in a few years. She has all the books and she is also an experienced runner. She is really prepared for the trail. Good luck and have fun!

I was really thankful for being ushered into their hot tub on the deck. Iain turned on the jets to the strongest setting after I popped in. Tiffany even brought me a beer later when I was being tumbled and massages all over. Impeccable service. Absolutely angelic.

Tomorrow I will pop in the new office at my old work place to disrupt stand ups and catch up with anyone there. Then it will be the Auckland coast to coast walk through mostly urban jungle.
