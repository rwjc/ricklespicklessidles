Good morning! Let’s go!

The DOC rangers were going to do some repairs on a swing bridge we passed through yesterday. They drove the truck. I stuck my thumb out. Got a good laugh. 

Hello sun!

Morning team, roll out!

There’s a lookout for Lake Sumner. So we dropped our packs at the sign and walked up. You can hardly see the lake.

Later on we do get some views of it though.

In one of the forest sections there were two falcons who are pretty territorial. They shriek and dive bombed us multiple times. We spent some time here to take photos and videos. It was quite fun.

Every now and then we come out to the cattle flats.

We had lunch at Hurunui Hut. There’s a small hula hoop here and a ball. It also has a nice big deck. I took a nap because it was so hot.

There were sheep here. Can’t believe they could withstand this heat.

5k later we reached the famed hot pool. It exceeded all expectations. Very hot, very nice to sit in. There’s even a cold water pipe that is fed by a side stream. Sandflies were not a problem also when we were there. Must have been the heat. 

![IMG_2944](/assets/images/20210113/img_2944.jpg)

![IMG_2952](/assets/images/20210113/img_2952.jpg)

After some serious soaking we had a swim in the river next door. It was refreshing and I felt really good. Hot pool + cold swim were one of the best things I’ve done on the TA. 

![IMG_2955](/assets/images/20210113/img_2955.jpg)

Team Hot Pools. 

![IMG_2953](/assets/images/20210113/img_2953.jpg)

Reluctantly we set off again. 

![IMG_2957](/assets/images/20210113/img_2957.jpg)

The weather was still perfect. 

![IMG_2964](/assets/images/20210113/img_2964.jpg)

Apparently it was snack time. 

![IMG_2965](/assets/images/20210113/img_2965.jpg)

No. 3 Hut. It’s a really cool hut. There are three-level bunks and the mattresses are extra wide. Just like Hopeless Hut in Nelson Lakes NP.

Another great day. No big climbs but the falcons and the hot pools are so worth it. 

Tomorrow: Harper Pass.
