Freshwater Hut to Halfmoon Bay

And with that, Rakiura North West Circuit is complete! It‚Äôs a fantastic challenging walk and I highly recommend it (if you like hiking/tramping; if not then you probably won‚Äôt enjoy it).

As we were packing just about to leave (Brad and Alice got in last night after I‚Äôve written the post), a white tail came strolling in just outside the hut. We watched it leisurely walk around the hut from the window. It saw us as well, but it didn‚Äôt seem too concerned.

About 2 minutes into the track to North Arm Hut I saw a kiwi.

20 minutes later I saw another one. So now 3 out of 6 days I‚Äôve seen 2 kiwis each time. Not bad.

Today had been drizzling on and off the whole day. None of it was heavy though. Also being under tree cover stopped most of the rain.

Thomson Ridge was much easier than what people reported it to be. I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs the hardest section. That for me was from East Ruggedy to Big Hellfire. I‚Äôve noticed a lot on the TA as well. Don‚Äôt let other people‚Äôs fears and horror stories scare you into thinking that something is too difficult to do. Just enjoy it your way and face it head on. 

North Arm Hut. It‚Äôs a Great Walk Hut, which means - toilet paper in the long drops! But I heard from a few people, including the nurses I met at Yankee River that there is a bedbug problem at this hut.

The supply of cards at this hut is staggering.

It‚Äôs the beach you can get to from behind the hut.

From North Arm to Halfmoon Bay is Great Walk quality. You can go really fast, it‚Äôs like an expressway.

When I got to town I had a cheese scone and a coffee.

For some reason all reasonable accomodation options are fully booked. The backpackers does have tent spaces but I didn‚Äôt bring a tent üò¨. They did have one tent that can be rented though. It‚Äôs already set up too. It‚Äôs massive. I can starfish in it and still not touch the sides.

I caught up with the boys at the fish and chips shop.

Tomorrow: back to Invercargill.
