In the morning Nikita cooked me a really nice scrambled eggs and bacon which I put on toast with fancy jam. That‚Äôs right you read that right. It was delicious. Their son Yunay is super cute and keeps giving me high fives and waving me goodbye. He had swimming lessons in the morning and Vipul drove me back to Pukerua Bay where I left off from yesterday.  Thanks Vips!

Quickly I was on the flax walkway which is a shared cycle track beside the state highway. It‚Äôs sheltered by plants so it was pleasant. 

I walked past a fenced dog recreational area and some people shooting arrows at balloons on animal shapes.

Aotea Lagoon is a pretty cool park. The playground in it was chocablock of kids and their parents. I didn‚Äôt take a photo because I don‚Äôt want to be mistaken for a homeless creepy hairy man which would actually be about 75% correct.

There was an adrenaline park where there are ladders and slings and all sorts of contraptions you could climb onto and move between the trees to make you feel like regret.

I got to the town of Porirua and sat in a park outside the swimming complex and had a lovely lunch Nikita packed for me from last nights dinner. It‚Äôs so good.

Before tackling the knobs I decided finally to replace my shredded shoes. I went to Torpedo7 and got some Hokas. The guy there said lots of hikers finish the Tararuas with broken shoes and come in there to get a new pair. Pro tip: be nice and ask for a discount.

Thank your for your service for the last 1000km.

Let‚Äôs do this.

The climb was pretty steep and it‚Äôs full of steps. It was hot too. But it‚Äôs like the Hakarimata near Ngaruawahia) and straightforward.

Views up the top were very nice.

The wind though, was not.

There were runners and mountain bikers too. I don‚Äôt know how they manage going into or being pinballed around by the wind. 

Getting down from the knob is a track through Spicer Forest. I kind of twisted my ankle here but it was not terrible and I kept going.

I got to the town of Ohariu and I didn‚Äôt want to do Mt Kaukau since of the foot and there‚Äôs not enough time before I need to meet up with Emma. She is a colleague and has so graciously offered to let me stay at her place. I hitched a ride with an old man (I told him my name; he just acknowledged without telling me his. Awkward) who has been living here for 40 years. He was telling me all the things that had happened all along the drive. He dropped me off at Te Papa in town. 

I met Emma at the Wellington Cenotaph and she took me to her place. It‚Äôs near a lot of pizza places. I‚Äôd be happy. She and her husband Chris are super keen trail runners. In fact she had just been running before we met. Check out their medal collection:

Care package for a tired hiker rolling into town:

They have a lovely house and I‚Äôm actually overwhelmed with their hospitality. 

They are also really into craft beers.

Relatable.

They had prepared a lot for dinner. Many of which were home made (bread) and home grown (broad beans and strawberries). Chris fired up the bbq and grilled some beef and capsicum. Eating is a job and I did great.

Their friendly cat Bumble.
