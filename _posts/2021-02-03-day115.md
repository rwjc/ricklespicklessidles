I checked the elevation profile. WTF Motatapu!?

We had lunch at the Glendhu Bay campground. Catherine’s wrap looked overfilled. (She hasn’t completed it yet to be fair).

While we were eating Keith drove up with Ciara in the passenger seat. He took all of us to the trailhead.

Last in first out.

It was so hot. Had a quick dip while we were still under the tree line.

We climbed and sidled to Fern Burn Hut, courtesy of Shania Twain.

Charlotte and Ciara drew some portraits at the back of the intentions book.

I camped. Because I wanted to. And also because I’m worth it.

FYI for those who want to sleep on the deck of this hut (which is really nice), be prepared to revive friendly visits by multiple possums in the night.
