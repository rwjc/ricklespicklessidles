Waipu Cove to Mangawhai 

31km ~ 8:07

Susan told me last night she would leave really early, to avoid the forecasted afternoon rain. She did just that. 6am packed and ready to go.

I had a really good sleep. Not sure why since there were a whole bunch of weekend campervans having late nights.

Nicola decided a rest day would do her well. So I went back on the trail to see what the weather has in store.

A runner with Hokas came up behind me. He slowed down to my pace and we started chatting. He knows all about TA so I asked him about the trail ahead. Being a runner he was really detailed about the kind of surface and how many kilometres that are coming up. He was doing a loop and soon he zoomed off into the distance in no time.

I had mostly overcast and breezy weather today which was perfect for hiking. 

After some climbs into a forestry road I came across a small piece of manicured grass. Very odd.

Forestry turned into a bush track, with some stealthy houses who don‚Äôt seem to be too friendly with hikers.

I passed through some views, and some sheep.

One happened to got out of the paddock but had no idea how to get back over the fence line. It thinks it‚Äôs trapped but I left enough room to the side and gestured it to go by. It got confused and ran right into the fence, bounced back and rag dolled on the ground. It finally got the message and sprinted by me as fast as it could.

I eventually got to the Mangawhai Cliffs Walkway which Lili was really excited to get to. I can see why.

It‚Äôs really nice. A family happened to be going the same way and they also knew about the TA. Generally people who are familiar with it asks me these questions:

1. When did you start?
2. Where did you walk from today?
3. How long have you walked today?
4. Are you having fun?

I‚Äôm getting pretty good at answering these questions.

They took a photo with me and the Bream Head / Te Whara track in the background where I was stuck the day before fully in clouds the whole way and had no view whatsoever. Who‚Äôs the view now *****.

After the cliff walk I dropped down to the beach and got to the car park behind the surf club and there happened to be a pop up coffee and frozen yogurt cart. Yes please. The man also knew about the TA.

Apparently water is the best drink but not good enough to have the fountain enabled. Maybe there are water restrictions in place.

So relatable right now.

I walked by an action playground facility (or something) and a bunch of places that sell coffee that are closed before they should be from what they advertised.

Accidental green tunnel to Mangawhai.

I arrived at the home of trail angels Mark and Kerry. Mark handed me a beer as I walked in üç∫! They have a plot of land next to their house with a little orchard and a small cabin set up specifically for TA hikers. It‚Äôs really cute.

Mark and Kerry had done the TA in 2018 and are also on the TA trust now. So they are quite in the know about what‚Äôs happening on the statuses of different trail sections. They were also very interested in a few sections about what I‚Äôve done so far. Especially around Russell forest. I‚Äôve heard rumours before when staying at Al and Sue‚Äôs earlier at Punaruku at the track through Russel forest will be closed down. And it looks like they will happen very soon unfortunately. That was a lovely track. They have plans to potentially work with a local iwi to open half of it. But we shall see. They are friends with James from Nikau Bay eco-camp as well. It‚Äôs great how many trail angels keep in touch with each other. Hopefully they are not impacted too much with the closures.

I had a fun call with a friend in Red Beach, Auckland. I‚Äôm hoping to get there before she goes to a festival in Wellington. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll get there in time but I‚Äôll bloody well try.

Tomorrow my plan is to get to Pakiri. There are more river crossings that may depend on tides. I hope I get the calculations right.
