Morena!

Today was meant to pour down. It did rain quite a bit overnight. But due to the wind my fly wasn‚Äôt too drenched. By the time I left camp Max was still in the tent and Riad just got up. Didn‚Äôt expect that.

Catherine told me yonks ago she wanted to see her lake. Well here is the track that‚Äôll take you there. It‚Äôs so far away though. Too long for a side trip.

The rain came and went, and then came back. Over and over. It almost felt like Auckland.

Last day on the TA. I twisted my ankle again, on a gravel road no less. You‚Äôd think I would be pretty good at walking by now, after thousands of kms, but no I still suck at it. What‚Äôs more, today was the first time I got chafing between my butt cheeks. Yes that‚Äôs right. It happened.

Today was predominantly gravel roads, except the Lake Hill track which was farmland beside the lake.

Most useful road sign ever.

Why turn when go straight do?

Feel so privileged right now.

The Rakaia, we meet again.

Back in Wellington Tahlia and Ayesha told me that you‚Äôre not a _true_ thruhiker unless you have a good poop story. Well, I have one now. It‚Äôs related to the butt cheeks chafe. I‚Äôll just leave it at that. Feel free to use your imagination. 

Yay made it.

There is a nice info board about braided rivers. I didn‚Äôt know they are uncommon in the world but are common in NZ.

‚ÄúThese tests saved the government much money‚Äù üëå

There‚Äôs a power station here. There‚Äôs a big board outside about all the deberteet rivers around the lake.

Darren from Methven campgrounds came and fetched me from the village. He‚Äôs a cool guy. I really like the little cabins they have.

Annelies texted me that she liked the comment I wrote in the Goat Pass Hut intentions book. I was there mid January.

My friend Freya is heading to Christchurch for softball nationals. I may see if I can catch up with her when I go through there as I start my way back north. 

Tomorrow: I will try to get to Nelson via Christchurch.
