Bulls to Palmy

22.43km ~ 1:18 (riding from Bulls to Feilding)

17.87km ~ 4:38 (hiking to Palmerston North)

The weather today was markedly different to what the forecast foretold. It was supposed to rain all day. There were massive clouds closing in as we got to midway just after Feilding. But it never really rained (only little drizzles) as the clouds were blown away by the strong winds). 

As planned Loïc let me ride his fancy mountain bike (with auto adjusting seat posts) to Feilding, where he’ll drop Tahlia off and we could walk together. She did this yesterday so she had a short day today.

By the way, Loïc has built a fantastic outdoor shelter for maximum chilling out. There’s a spa, massive TV, bbq, pizza oven, couches, and decorated with propellers from an old plane he used to fly.

Off I go!

The ride was very pleasant (once out of the big Bulls bridge and into the quiet country roads). There was a long downhill section that was magical if you’re on a bike. The junctions are all adequately marked with blazes and orange markers so I didn’t need to stop and check whether I’m on the right path. 

I got to Feilding in no time. Well, technically an hour and a bit.

Fun fact: Feilding does not have traffic lights. So it’s all about the round abouts.

Soon after I got to the clock tower I heard some yelling from a car going around. It was everybody. 

I went to a carpark and swapped the bike for the pack. 

Time to say goodbye...

After the frenchies left we went directly to a cafe (actually it took us forever to find a place we wanted).

There was a cute baby next table over who loved to wave.

Hiker trash leaving Feilding.

The clouds are fast closing in from behind. But since we have been expecting the worst since the morning it felt fine.

The trail mostly followed the road most direct to Palmy. Sometimes it is on a quieter road parallel to the state highway. At one point it went off-road and somehow managed to route through a stream crossing. The headwaters must have been loaded since the stream was high and fast. We backtracked and walked on the road instead.

Explorer mode engaged. Tahlia found the next marker.

Can you see it?

We came across a small paddock with lots of horny (literally) looking bulls that looked aggressive. We didn’t want to risk it so we went to the house next door and see if anyone could help us. The man of the family came out and told us they are actually cows and they are actually really friendly. Us city dwellers don’t know anything.

Almost to Palmy!

At some point a big truck zoomed by and the large draft hit a bee and the bee got slammed into Tahlia’s leg and she got stung. She is fine but it was kind of funny.

We made our way to the trail angel Karen’s place. She did the TA last season and has some great stories to tell. She was the only hiker last year (she liked to remind us) that were search & rescued twice. She is lovely. 

There was another TA hiker there - Genny. She is from the UK and looks really onto it. There are lots of people trying to get to the Tararuas during a good weather window. It should be next Monday. Hopefully the forecasts don’t change too much. 

Karen has a large library of adventure books so I wasn’t surprised to find Cheryl Strayed #3.

She also has a bunch of funky memorabilia around the house. This is Java.

We went out to the nearby New World to resupply and buy something for dinner. Dinner assemble!

Keen shares a lot of stories from last year’s TA season, including advice and suggestions for the Tararua ranges whixh is her backyard. She’s incredibly helpful; Genny and I gave her the food we will when we start to climb into the ridges and she’ll deliver them to us from Levin in 3 days. Hopefully it works out. 

Tomorrow: Whare o Moturimu hut
