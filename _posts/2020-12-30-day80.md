Mt Rintoul Hut to Mid Wairoa Hut

16.7km ~ 7:16

The clouds cleared during the night at around 3am (I was told) when it suddenly got quite cold in the tent.

It was lovely climbing up to Purple Top. The surround views were really great. You could see rows of the southern alps in the distance.

Mt Rintoul in the background. You could see the line of scree we came down from the top yesterday.

Vapor trails.

On the way we passed Steve (who had left a little earlier). He has stopped and were in the process of unpacking his pack. He said something was vibrating. We could hear it clearly. Turns out it was his electric razor. He took the battery out and started to repack. His trail name (maybe): Vibrator.

The track took us down into the bush, where we met a surprisingly curious robin when we sat down and had a break. It kept circling around Genny‚Äôs pack and poking at her bright orange PLB.

Familiar territory.

Thanks for telling us.

Tarn Hut. We dried our tents here in the large sunning clearing (visited by goats when we got there). Jack was here already and we had a break in the hut. It‚Äôs quite a nice hut.

It is next to a large tarn!

On the way down we met a NOBO girl Nicky üá≥üáø who is going to Tarn Hut. She told us about the upcoming tracks. From Mid Wairoa hut to Top Wairoa hut will have many river crossings and some potentially tricky sidles. We decided to stay at Mid Wairoa hut. One is to get there in time to get bunks. Another is to take a dip in the nearby water hole which Nicky said is fantastic. 

Swing bridge.

Mid Wairoa hut. Better than it looks.

The river nearby which is the hut‚Äôs water supply.

The water was quite cold. I took a dip and swam up into the rapid. It was fun. The strong flow felt a bit like a jet stream. Genny couldn‚Äôt make herself get into the water fully. She promised next time.

Further upstream is a magical place.

The main problem with huts that are near bodies of water is: sandflies. They are EVERYWHERE.
