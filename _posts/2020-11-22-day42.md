Paul from Camp Epic arranged to have a bike dropped off for me at their camp at 9:30am. So I had plenty of time to sleep in and get ready. Camp Epic is only 1km from Piropiro.

I met Josh, who is I think Paul‚Äôs son. He was responsible for a big group of 25 ladies. They are going the same way as I am. He told me someone else will bring the bike in later, and showed me the kitchen where I could help myself. I made hot chocolate and toast, using my own honey of course.

While I was making second breakfast Josh briefed the ladies on what to expect on today‚Äôs trail. I heard the words ‚Äòwaterfall‚Äô, ‚Äòmud‚Äô, ‚Äòhill‚Äô. I‚Äôll need to ask him to clarify these later. During his speech, his dog was whining and wagging the whole time to try and get his attention away from the group. It was cute.

I gave them my pack, and I was ready to roll!

There were more huge suspension bridges today.

After the first bridge was the main big climb I have today. Climbing in bicycles feel so much harder than walking. Maybe I‚Äôm just not used to it. 

Literally unridable.

I caught up to Wayne about 18km in. We were just happened to be beside that waterfall Josh mentioned.

Later having a snacks break at a shelter we met a bunch of ladies and gents doing some variation of the Tour Aotearoa, going NOBO. A super tanned lady said she started from the bottom 43 days ago to get here. I took 42 days coming from the top! Riders go brrrrr.

![IMG_3920](/assets/images/20201122/img_3920.jpg)

At this point the big group of ladies this morning past me. I thought they were gone, so I started riding. But more came behind me and I was stuck between two groups of ladies. Well, I learnt a lot about nutrition and more importantly juicy gossip about how ‚Äòhe‚Äô didn‚Äôt deserve her and how ‚Äòhe‚Äô should judge others less and so on and so forth. At some point the ladies in the front realized I wasn‚Äôt part of the clique and let me go.


I don‚Äôt know why I made that face.

I do know why I made this face coming up to the ‚Äúspiral‚Äù and tunnel though. It‚Äôs dark and scary.

I just realized I was wearing my hat under the helmet. It looks ridiculous. 

Wayne told me that he saw another tent at Piropiro that might belong to another TA hiker. I think it might be Vlastimil and it turned out to be right. I caught up with him soon after and he is aiming to get to the end of the trail. A big day for him.

For the last 10km or so it‚Äôs all downhill. It even got narrower and bumpier. So much fun! The km markers went by so fast. It made me sad that tomorrow I will need to go back to walking like a peasant. 

I got to the Bennett Campsite in early afternoon. It‚Äôs set up by the TA trust built by the locals and it‚Äôs really nice. The Camp Epic container is also here. I traded in the bike (and the fee) for my pack and relaxed in the sun. 

![IMG_3936](/assets/images/20201122/img_3936.jpg)

There were lots of people here waiting for their ride or the rest of their group to come.

I set up my tent with great views. Then I took a lovely nap.

Late afternoon Vlastimil arrived at the camp and collapsed to the ground. I told him about where to get water and then he set up just tent and immediately went to rest.

Wayne came in later as well. He wasn‚Äôt planning to get here today but he felt so good on the trail it made him go the extra distance! Good on him!

There was a couple in a massive bus at the campsite. Cam and Karen, from Whangarei. They are super friendly. We ended up having a long chat, first outside and after the sun went down they invited us into their magical school bus. 

![IMG_3944](/assets/images/20201122/img_3944.jpg)

They made us tea and a great big chicken curry with rice for dinner! It was fantastic! They are keen riders and have been travelling all over New Zealand in the bus and biking local trails. Karen even told us about their stint in Perth back in the day which was very interesting.

Scott messaged me. They are getting to Bog Inn hut and there was some hail! We got a bit of a drizzle but nothing too bad. The weather cleared up and I hope it stays like this.
