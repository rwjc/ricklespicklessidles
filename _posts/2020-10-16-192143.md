Ahipara Holiday park to Mangamuka route campsite

14km hitch to Kaitaia
23.8km hike to Mangamuka campsite ~ 6:04

After getting another hot shower in the morning at the holiday park (I miss you hot water üò¢), I packed up and walked across town to have my first pie on the trail. Not sure why but it was very special to me.

Then I checked out the local fish and chips shop. Surprise! It‚Äôs closed. No one have fish and chips for breakfast don‚Äôt be ridiculous. There‚Äôs also a coffee shop across the school, which rang its school bell as I walked passed. It triggered memories of despair. I quickly walked past the hordes of parents and children.

I thought I‚Äôd try out hitching a ride to Kaitaia as opposed to walking the 14km on a busy and dangerous highway. I put down my pack, removed my sunnies and hat, put on my biggest smile and stuck out the thumb. The first lady smiled back with a sorry face and with fingers crossed. Okay I‚Äôll let you off this time. The second was a police car so I quickly unstuck my limb and pretended to be checking out the surrounding beauty. The third one saw me and with a big smile herself indicated and pulled over right away. From the first to the last it took 10 seconds for me to get in a car. Success!

The nice lady who picked me up is ‚Äúgood for you‚Äù Nadia. She has a local plumbing business. The business is a-booming because of all the new builds happening up north. Good plumbing = happy people. When we were talking about what I‚Äôm doing just about every thing I say she responds with ‚Äúgood for you‚Äù. This is not meant to sound like I didn‚Äôt want her to say that. In fact it was the opposite. There seems to be two groups of people I meet. One is incredulous and wonders why in the world I would want to walk all this way, the other is really excited and gives me lots of encouragement. I think people who enjoy more outdoorsy activities tend to be the latter. Nadia turns out to be a ballet dancer and has actually run on 90 mile beach for some sort of event. That means she has strong legs and she knows how tough going it is on the beach.

I was dropped in Pak N Sav in Kaitaia. It‚Äôs actually a bit out of the Main Street. Along the way Nadia told me about the history of various buildings and some have fallen to hard times. I can tell she felt nostalgic and was a bit sorrowful. She has a strong connection to the town.

For a moment I didn‚Äôt recall how to function in a supermarket. Then I remembered and got what I wanted. I spent an enormous amount of time sorting out my shopping outside. E.g. removing the contents of the Shapes from its packaging and into my own ziplock bag. This way I can keep the bulk down.

Finally I started walking back to the town, searching for food. I went to Gecko Cafe which was recommended by Nadia.

After lunch I went back on the trail. I passed a tree which I think is a loquat tree. I picked some and ate them. Quite sweet. I wonder why the local birds haven‚Äôt gotten to them yet.

Then comes the long and arduous road walks to the edge of Raetea Forest. Some are paved, some are gravelly. But I do know my favourite part to walk on is the small grassy bits to the side (when they exist).

It‚Äôs actually really hard on the legs and feet walking on the road with a heavy pack for prolonged periods of time. There‚Äôs a difference between that and the beach walk days previously.

The grasses however are heavenly. The relief you get when your feet first lands on the soft cushiony green goodness after a few k‚Äôs of road cannot be described properly by words. It‚Äôs like walking on babies‚Äô thighs. (just to clarify I have never done this)

When the full sun came out, I finally whipped out the umbrella. It makes everything better. It blocks your whole upper body from the sun, and the temperature drops right now. I‚Äôm so glad I took this thing!

Farm animals along this track:

Let‚Äôs RICKIT!

Eventually I limped into the campsite. It feels like every day I always end up doing this. When will I get my trail legs!?

There I met Simon, who is from Warkworth. We had a small chat about tents and other hikers we‚Äôve met. Seems like I was a bit faster than some others. Many took a zero (no contribution to the trail progress) at Kaitaia and just relaxed. I should have done that to rest my legs and feet. Tomorrow will be the second unofficial ‚Äúrite of passage‚Äù for the TA (the first being 90 mile beach). It is said that if you pass these two trials you have what it takes to finish the whole thing. It‚Äôs going to be brutal - Raetea Forest - the name itself conjures fear and panic to hikers who dared enter its domain. Let‚Äôs see how it will unfold, tomorrow.

Also, first time trying avocado with instant noodles. It‚Äôs really good!
