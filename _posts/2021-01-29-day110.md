Morning morning morning.

On the way to the Ahuriri river we met a hunter with his two dogs. He camped outside the night before. It must have been really cold. 

We reached the river and it looked sketchy.

Three of us linked up but Ciara went charging in solo. Halfway through she changed her mind and linked up with us. The Ahuriri was fast and cold. It was about waist deep where we crossed. We eventually got across. On this side of the river we are now officially in Otago!

Then we climbed this little rocky hill.

Afterwards we came across a 2500K marker someone made.

I cleaned up the rocks a bit and it looked more legible.

We walked in the valley on a 4WD track.

![IMG_3991](/assets/images/20210129/img_3991.jpg)

We had lunch. Beside some rocks. 

![IMG_3995](/assets/images/20210129/img_3995.jpg)

Soon we went by a private hut - The Tin Hut.

It’s a really cute hut. We decided to stay here instead of pushing on to the next hut. There were chairs and a couple of real mattresses. It’s also right next to a flowing stream. 

![IMG_4005](/assets/images/20210129/img_4005.jpg)

![IMG_4006](/assets/images/20210129/img_4006.jpg)

The first thing all of us did after reaching the hut was a nap. 

![IMG_4180](/assets/images/20210129/img_4180.jpg)

We sat outside and enjoyed the sun and chatted. 

![IMG_4009](/assets/images/20210129/img_4009.jpg)

Joe and Caleb rocked up soon after. They had done some big days before. They had also night hiked the bits we cycled from Tekapo. 

![IMG_4010](/assets/images/20210129/img_4010.jpg)

Caleb showed us his big toe. It is big. Ciara named them for him. Toay and Toby.

Charlotte compared her pinky toe with his big toe. 

![IMG_4014](/assets/images/20210129/img_4014.jpg)

Nice evening. We played a game of naming all the things in Ciara’s pack. I didn’t win but I did end up doing better than Charlotte. She was none too pleased.
