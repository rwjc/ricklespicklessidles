Nero in Taumarunui 

4km ~ 14min (hitch)

I checked out of the motel in the morning, and the cool people at Taumarunui Canoe Hire (TCH from here on) came and picked us up at the New World to go to their base camp for a briefing at 7am. 

TCH is a family-run business and everyone is fantastically helpful and friendly. Karen and Ron and their family offers pick ups and drop offs from town (sometimes even to neighbouring towns), free tea/coffee, toast, free camping, power, warm and comfy place to hangout. It‚Äôs a great place.

Jonathan was in charge of giving us the briefing to what they offer and what we can expect. There were others here too who are not doing the TA. We will probably end up starting from Whakahoro in about 7 days time.

After the briefing they dropped us back into town. Wayne will checkout and Vlastimil will stay here for a couple more days. 

On the way to the market?

I had _a lot_ of time to kill. I have gone around the town centre multiple times.

A bit of Thai for lunch.

We arranged to be picked up again in the afternoon. But before that I needed to resupply for both the days ahead and for the Whanganui journey after that. We will put these in a barrel and they will take these to the starting point when we get to it after the Tongariro side trip. This is the result.

When I was picked up by Ron, he told me that I was not the only one. Later we swung around to the i-Site and got two other hikers. It turned out to be Brian whose progress I‚Äôve been following and his wife Kelly. They have a campervan (Kelly is supporting him) at the TCH and are also staying there tonight. 

Wayne and I are staying in a container set up for hikers. It doesn‚Äôt look like much on the outside but it‚Äôs quite good inside.

Brian invited us to their campervan later to have a cup of tea. Karen and Ron came as well. Oh, Bella too:

We didn‚Äôt end up just having tea. It turned out Brian and Kelly had bought 10 Rangiriri Pies (frozen) from Cathy when they went there and Kelly reheated one in their gas oven for us to share! It was as devine as I remembered.

By the way, their campervan is so fancy. It‚Äôs like a moving futuristic castle.

Brian also cooked up some chorizo sausages. We ate them with toothpicks. It was high class.

Very happy to meet Brian and Kelly. Such fun and friendly couple. 

Tomorrow: either Owhango or stay out.
