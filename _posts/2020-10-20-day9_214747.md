Yesterday, there was a family of quails scurrying about. This morning they came out again. Simon told us all the ways you can cook a quail. My mouth was watering.

The plan is to get to Kerikeri. I haven’t decided where to stay yet. I am going to wing it and see where I end up. Simon already has a place booked for a few days and then Pahia for another few days. He is going to meet her wife there and stay for some time. This means we will probably not see him for some time.

Usually the trail goes through some farmland here, but the farm route is closed because of cow business.
We have no choice but to take the road. 

One property I walked pass had a fence line full of skinned pig. I’m impressed but also somewhat terrified.

At the end of the road section was a section on **state highway 10** which was ridiculously busy. Cars and trucks fly by at ridiculous speeds. And there’s a bridge of death where you have no bloody room to walk. You just have to look back and time it and run as fast as you can before the next car comes. Ridiculous.

Along the way I’ve come across many honesty fruit stands. I couldn’t get any because I cannot for the life of me carry a whole bag of fruit, not matter how delicious. After the bridge of death I come across a man selling a lot of fruit. I bought a punnet of strawberries and they are very sweet.

After the road sections is a walk along the Kerikeri River. It is a very nice walk.

The Rainbow Falls is fantastic! So nice being so close to town. No wonder everyone and their mum want to buy property here. I was by myself pretty much the whole time just gazing into the riffraff and soaking up everything nature has to offer. I did a sound of music and then a lady just silently appeared as I turned around. She looked at me; I looked at her. I left.

Cheeky look back since I was going so slow. The guy walking the dogs actually pass me twice. Once on one way, then he turned around and passed me again. The first time round the dogs were a little jumpy and aggressive. But when they came back somehow they came all friendly and wanted pats. I gave them what they wanted of course.

Once I reached Kerikeri I decided to stay at Hone Heke which is super chill and has a nice vibe. I found other TA hikers here. I met Charlotte and Nicola (whom I met on the river safety course). I also met Liam who is going to start the TA on 1 November. Good luck! Charlotte is really knowledgeable about the art and crafts world and seems to be on the path to become very successful herself!

I went out to have a proper dinner for awhile.

The moment I ate the first chip is bliss you cannot describe with words.
