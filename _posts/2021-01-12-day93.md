For breakfast we went back to Powerhouse because it‚Äôs so good. Gotta fill myself with healthy goodness before the next stretch of dehydrated mishmash nonsense. 

The avo smash is really good.

Lovely Hanmer Springs.

Catherine didn‚Äôt feel very well. She decided to stay here another day to rest. Kate and Ciara will stay here with her to hike out together tomorrow or when she feels better. Jack, Walter, and Steve had booked a shuttle the next morning. I wanted to get going so I went out on my lonesome.

I was by myself briefly before I started to walk out of the town trying for a hitch. I met Tokoroa Paul who was doing the same. He also came in last night but stayed at a different place. We got a hitch and on the way we squeezed in another TA hiker Chris (Queenstown). He is very into endurance sports and knows a lot about them. Our drivers are two fit AF ladies who were just out going to run up a steep mountain, as you do. They are into competitive orienteering. Their track starts at Boyle Village, exactly where we wanted to go. Perfect.

At Boyle, Paul went off to look at the campsite. He may stay here or continue based on what he feels like. It was around 12pm. I had paid for a pizza and a drink online so I came here to claim them.

There was a TA hiker box here. I found some dressing and gajujiang to add to my pizza. Robin and Andy were also there. They stayed here the night before and will head off to take a break from the trail for a bit. 

Chris had a food box sent here by his friend. His friend packed it for him so he didn‚Äôt know what to expect. It was a lot of food and too much for him to carry. So he was trying to eat all the things he had to leave behind. He tried to give me some chocolate which was really tempting but my pack was also full of food. 

Eventually we got going. Chris will do the Tui track from
Boyle but i was going to do a little hitch to Windy Point to rejoin the trail. It took about 15 min but a guy picked me up. He actually saw me as he went by, drove down the road for a few kilometres, and then turned around to come back to get me. Super nice. He is a fireman and has a dog named ‚ÄúPickle‚Äù.

There were belly rubs.

From there I entered the Lake Sumner Forest Park and on the Hope Kiwi Track. It was so hot. Probably one of the hottest days so far. Last time I felt this hot was probably the Helena Ridge Track back in Northland. I ended up undoing all the buttons on my shirt. The air flow was great. I may do this from now on whenever it‚Äôs hot. Other hikers and modesty be damned.

I reached Hope Half Way Hut. Malcolm had left me a note in the intentions book telling me to hurry up and catch up to him. He didn‚Äôt go to Hanmer Springs and continued from Boyle. That‚Äôs how he got in front of me. 

![IMG_2841](/assets/images/20210112/img_2841.jpg)

I walked through little bushes and big valleys, and then some cattle farms. It reminded me of the North Island (the cattle part).

![IMG_2848](/assets/images/20210112/img_2848.jpg)

I crossed the Hope River.

It‚Äôs not too much unlike Hopeless River in the Nelson Lakes NP. I wonder what the stories are.

Soon I got to Hope Kiwi Lodge. It‚Äôs one of the best huts I‚Äôve seen. There were two DOC rangers here too - Duncan and Janille. 

![IMG_2861](/assets/images/20210112/img_2861.jpg)

Duncan drove in on his truck with his dog ‚ÄúEd‚Äù. We actually saw each other when I was trying to get a hitch at Boyle. He thought I wanted to hitch into Hanmer Springs so he didn‚Äôt stop. 

![IMG_2866](/assets/images/20210112/img_2866.jpg)

He whipped out a tennis racquet and a ball. We used it to play fetch with Ed. Whacking a ball is just so satisfying.

Malcom, Michael, Chris üá®üá¶ and Dani are here as well. There was also a lady doing some packrafting. 

Tomorrow: one hut or two towards Harper Pass.
