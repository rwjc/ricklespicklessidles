Forest Creek Carpark to Felt Hut

Our shuttle is 11am, a few hours later than the first group. We spent some time at the cafe. Some of us are a little childish.

It was unexpectedly busy on the road to the trailhead, which is in the middle of nowhere.

Wayne told us that we are going to go over the ridge in the distance. It seems a lot closer than it actually was. Instead of the official TA trail via Bush Stream, we took the route through Forest Creek and over Bullock Bow Saddle. After the saddle it will rejoin the TA. Wayne told us it’s the “official” alternative route in case Bush Stream is in flood.

Just dropped off; getting ready to start hiking. It was really windy. Ciara cut a hole on the top of her bucket hat so her hair can come through like a pineapple.

Off we go!

Having a break on the river bed.

Everyday is wet boot day.

Trying to get everyone in the shot was difficult on the move.

We once again made the mistake of trying to go on a side bank to avoid crossing the river. We got bluffed out so had to descent prematurely. It was a tricky one and Ciara had a slip and ended up getting stopped by a spikey boi in between her legs. She was in pain but it was pretty funny. 

One of the huts around this here place that’s called “Stone Hut”.

After a long rocky river walk (not again), we finally arrived at the junction that starts the climb onto the ridge.

Keith and I stopped to wait for the others. We both had a Subway sub to devour. Back at Geraldine while waiting at the cafe, I asked Ciara to pop in to Subway to get it for me, since it’s on her way. So worth it. Though next time I should get a foot-long.

After a steep but short climb we saw to a reasonable place to camp.

We camped in the open. Should have good views when the sun rises, barring any clouds. Hopefully it won’t be too windy tonight. There’s a hut nearby in the trees - Felt Hut. We were told it’s private so we didn’t go and investigate.

Dinner circle.

Ciara is so Irish. She had a bag of instant mash potatoes, but inside the bag was another bag of instant mash potatoes. We found out Keith has a tattoo on the bottom of his foot - “shit will buff out”. Apparently it’s a saying on the PCT, which he did in 2016.

I used a packet of homemade dehydrated vegetables I found in the hiker box at Arthur’s Pass in my noodles. It’s very nice.

Goodnight.
