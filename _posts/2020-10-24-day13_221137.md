Punaruku to Whananaki

31km ~ 8:36
Hitched for about 8km from Sue and Al‚Äôs to Helena Bay.

It was a lazy start to the day. The bed was just so ridiculously soft. I had a really nice breakfast. Lili also made me some scrambled eggs. Loved it.

It took even longer to get going. Because there were distractions.

The distractions:

Lili left first and I told her I‚Äôll catch up. I soon realized I wasn‚Äôt going to catch up. She is always fast in the morning.

Al told me about the trails ahead. There are a couple of bush tracks - Helena ridge track and Morepork. He knows the doc estimated times for these. It‚Äôll take about 7-9 hours to get to Whananaki. I didn‚Äôt realize that the time was from the beginning Of the Helena ridge track which is actually about 11km away.

I walked for a few k‚Äôs and a car pulled up and asked me if I was okay. I yelled yes as another car came up behind and pushed him to go on. Not too long later another one pulled up and offered me a lift. The road started to get a bit dangerous and busy (being labour weekend and all), so I accepted. The lady was going to a festival and first will pick up her sister from Whangarei (tempting but no I only went a few kilometres to Helena Bay). She said that she used to hitch hiker all over Europe - from England to Turkey, and thought ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôll just pick up this dude‚Äù.

This meant I leap frogged Lili and got to Helena bay first, where she will meet Hugo and go have a wonderful time in the car (and probably elsewhere too).

I decided to stay at the beach to wait for her and said goodbye (for now).

When she did eventually come in she knew I cheated. And she made me say it out loud and she recorded it. But she agreed with me since that last few k‚Äôs actually got really dangerous and would also hitch if someone offered (I‚Äôm surprised no body had pulled up and asked her yet). 

<blockquote><small>‚ÄùI cheated.‚Äù</small></blockquote>

She has a Vlog and I will find it and add it when I get service again. (Edit: here it is go follow her!)

Long way to Whananaki. Not sure if I will have sunlight when I get there.

A little bit up the ridge track I got hunted down by Dudley:

It was incredibly hot and humid climbing up and he got my scent a long way away and he ran away from his man and caught me soon after.

I came to the campsite a farmer has set up for TA walkers. It has a nice grassy area and a full water tank. But it was only 3pm and I didn‚Äôt want to just chill there by myself and I thought I‚Äôd make it to a bach owned by my mates parents which is near the Otamure campsite past Whananaki. I was a bit tired but I was confident that pushing on will be fine. If I had to I can camp in the forest.

‚ÄúNot my job‚Äù:

Onward to the second forest of the day. Morepork track plus Onekainga track to Whananaki. This one is pretty hard. Today had the largest elevation gain and loss so far on the trail - around 1300m each, mostly in this section. Multiple long steep up and down bits, be prepared.

Once out of the forest I still had to get to the bach, which is about 6km away. Luckily a couple (Rachael and Cam) drove by not long after who happened to be going to their own bach in the same direction. After they watching me struggling to put my pack up into the back seat, and trying to stuff myself getting into said back seat, we took off. They are nice people.

I found the bach with no problems (I‚Äôve never been there before), getting there just before sunset around 6:30pm. It‚Äôs so nice. I haven‚Äôt seen Robyn and John in a while and it was great to meet them again. They already ate but they prepared a feast for me anyway. 

Yep that‚Äôs crayfish ü¶û, freshly caught.

They spent the day fishing and paddling and enjoying life. They had other family there as well and they were shocked in hearing what I was doing.

A nice soft bed again! So blessed!

Tomorrow I might take a zero to hang out some more. Maybe even go fishing! Definitely sleeping in though.
