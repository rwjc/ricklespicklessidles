description: going down the Hihikiwi track proved to be muddy as heck. But strangely it was also kind of fun.

My. Pirongia to Te Rauamoa

20.42km ~ 7:12

First time sleeping in a hut on the TA. Felt pretty good. Morning cup of tea:

There were clouds all around, but just as we about to leave they all lifted. To get down we will go on the Hihikiwi Track, through the Hihikiwi peak slightly to the left in the view below.

From the hut to Hihikiwi was 100% boardwalks which was impressive.

At the top!

This next bit is muddy and NSFW. Pretty much the whole way down (and up) had some amount of mud.

It looks bad but it could be worse (rainy, slippery, zombies). I was able to navigate around or over the mud by stepping on roots or rocks. It was like solving a puzzle. Picking the right path to go when facing a new mud pool and then executing the right moves with each foot and hand hold. It was quite fun! If we were climbing this track it would be totally different though. I stepped into the mud with a foot twice accidentally. I thought the ground looked firm but they were not. Don’t trust the ground!

There was a good flowing stream at the end of the track to clean out the mud and refill the water bottles. We rested and had snacks. It took me exactly 3 hours from the hut, for 5.6km. Pretty slow going.

On the way to the road where there were multiple trail angels was a slightly different walker road sign. Somebody had taped up a back pack on the figure. I thought that was cool.

I got to Jo’s place. As I sat down on the bench she provided by the road (she also provides a hikers’ rubbish bin which is awesome) she drove up her driveway and we had a chat before she went off. I told her we might continue on a little bit more since we’ve got time and we’d like to make tomorrow’s day a bit shorter if possible. She was totally cool about it. 

She showed me to the garage where there were goodies set up for hikers. I looked at the visitor book. It was full of photos of people who had passed through. Jo is part of the [Te Araroa Project](https://www.facebook.com/Araroaproject/) which aims to document the people of the trail.

I waited for the others and we all decided to go to the next one about 3km away. Just as we got there it started to drizzle. The owner drove in shortly after - Casey. She came back from shopping in Te Awamutu, about 30min drive away. 

Casey’s house is a large villa from the 1890s with gardens. She also has a goat named Jeremy.

We made dinner and chat under the porch.

Tomorrow - Waitomo. Looking forward to the hot tub.
