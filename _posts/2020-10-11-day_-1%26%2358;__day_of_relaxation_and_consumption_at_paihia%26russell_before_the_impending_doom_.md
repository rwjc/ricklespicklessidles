Today I left my cozy place in Auckland and drove up to Paihia with my family.

We took some rest and went on a ferry to Russell to see what the fuss was all about.

Russell was lovely. I wished we had more time to check it out properly.

We had dinner at an absolutely fabulous place - “The Duke Of Marlborough Hotel”. The lamb shoulder was the best I’ve ever had!

Ended the day back at the motel organising the resupply for the first leg of the T.A. I think I packed too much food; I’m afraid I will learn to regret this.

Russell was referred to as a “hell hole” back in its heady days.

1.2kg of lamb (shared between 2)

Way way to much (maybe).
