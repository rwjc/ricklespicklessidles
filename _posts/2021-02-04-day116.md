title: Day 116&#58; Motatapu2. Straight up, straight down - the Kiwi Way
description: 3 big hills. Wasn‚Äôt too bad since it wasn‚Äôt infernally hot. The downside is that there were no views for half of the day.

Morena! Sadly it rained overnight and it was very misty.

One good thing about a fresh chill misty morning is that climbing all those hills would be a breeze.

Last night there was chaos. The CCCs cowboy camped with mattresses on the nice deck of the hut. But when the sun went down the sandflies and mosquitos start to appear. Mitch and Olaf came late; but another couple of hikers came in even later and caused a ruckus cooking and giggling at about 10pm - while everyone was going to sleep. Another thing that started to appear was the horde of possums that invade at night. They came really close to the cowboy campers, just staring at them from a few cms away. To make things worse there were some heavy snorers in the hut. So the CCCs were in a pickle. I only heard about this the next morning. I was in my tent having a great time. Only one possum came to check me out. But it quickly went away because I was too well protected. 

There was also a drunk guy who was being ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù and ‚Äúweird‚Äù. Luckily for me I‚Äôm not his type. 

2 things I weren‚Äôt expecting to deal with on this section:

1. Rain and cold
2. Giving relationship advice from the male perspective

The first hill was Jack Hall‚Äôs Saddle

No views except ourselves.

On the way to Highland Creek Hut we met 3 cool AF NOBO ladies. They looked really glad meeting people and chatting to them. We had a nice chat. We noticed that NOBOs (at this stage anyway) tend to describe track difficulties to be a lot harder than they actually are. That‚Äôs okay though. They‚Äôll learn. 

We couldn‚Äôt see very far unfortunately.

Highland Creek Hut. One big hill done.

Right after the hut there was a steep straight-up bit. The CCCs are actually all in the photo climbing. But they are probably hard to pick out.

Ominous.

The clouds started clearing just after lunch.

We took a break at a river. 2 big hills done. One to go.

Going down on the last big hill we could see Roses Hut very far away. It‚Äôs pretty much in the centre of the photo.

Final push to the hut.

Kate and Ed were here when we arrived. They did a short day today so they were just chilling and eating lots of food. They found out about our new trail name for Sexy Chris. It‚Äôs Mid-Life Chrisis. They thought it was hilarious.

Also, Kate and Ed thought Vlastimil is a girl. What happened was, they had met a girl who (they thought) was from the Czech Republic, but they hadn‚Äôt caught her name. When they saw Vlastimil‚Äôs name in the hut books and that he put down his country of origin they thought it was her. They didn‚Äôt believe me when I said Vlastoff is a dude. They even made me doubt myself and I tried to remember all the things that confirmed he is a he. 1. peeing standing up, check. 2. stubbles on the face, check. Neither of these things conclusively prove his manhood but I was damn sure. Turns out the girl they met was from Moldova üá≤üá© . I stand corrected. Get your facts straight!

The tracks today were not as bad as I expected. It‚Äôs partly due to the weather - it wasn‚Äôt so hot that we needed to carry extra water, which would have been the worst. I‚Äôm still pretty tired though. 

Charlotte (Cryalotte or Hunchback of Wellington) was watching something on her phone and giggling quite intensively.
