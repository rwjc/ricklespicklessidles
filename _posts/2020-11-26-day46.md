Hikumutu to Owhango

16.01km ~ 3:53

In the morning Ron gave Tahlia and Jacqui the TA Whanganui journey briefing - from Whakahoro to Whanganui. Vlastimil, Wayne and I also sat in it again to get more info from a different perspective.

üêë in the garage.

I stuffed my barrel up to the lid full of food, snacks, and drinks.

Bye Bella!

After the briefing, Brian took Wayne and I back to where we go to yesterday, about 10km into the trail towards Owhango. It rained nonstop.

Happy to be back on the trail. Even though it was raining, cold, and road walking.

Misty and wet. It was actually quite pleasant.

I had thought there was nothing in town for us. But then we discovered there is a cafe! Surprise cafe is the best. The Blue Hill Cafe opens 8am to 3pm everyday except Tuesdays.

It rained heavily for hours. We chilled in the cafe for a long time, waiting for the rain to die down. While having more coffee to make sure we didn‚Äôt overstay our welcome we saw a campervan pulled over the public toilets which was on the other side of the road. It was Brian and the others! They were on their way to Whakapapa Village. We hadn‚Äôt planned to meet here but it was good timing. We had a chat under the awning (in the cold) of the cafe. Tahlia found a nice jacket in the hiker box at the TCH. I had forgotten to check out the hiker box. I could‚Äôve probably left something there (and maybe picked up something else). We separated again, probably meeting up later on after the canoeing. 

Eventually the rain did soften up and we reluctantly left the warm coziness of the cafe.

It was only 2km to the start of the 42nd Traverse, by a bridge on the Whakapapa River where we planned to make camp. On the way there is a nice bush track called the Lagoon Walk. It is a neat and relaxing track to finish with after the road walk.

I ate a panini I took away from the cafe after got to camp and set up the tent. Then I hid inside to escape from the rain. Spent some time on the kindle, and then cooked dinner.
