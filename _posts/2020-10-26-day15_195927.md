Whananaki to Matapouri to Sandy Bay

14km ~ 3:53 (Whananaki to Sandy Bay)

4km ~ 1:01 (Sandy Bay to Matapouri)

After a early morning fishing session John dropped me off at the beginning of the Whananaki estuary track, which is where I last left the trail. Before I left Robyn gave me a rendition of a “Croatian horn blowing farewell”. Honestly I didn’t know what had happened, but it was lovely.

Soon I reached the “longest footbridge in the Southern Hemisphere”, if I had remembered correctly.

I found a water cache behind a marker in Whananaki south. Thanks angels!

Soon after the Whananaki Coastal Walkway started. It’s actually quite pleasant.

In the middle there is a side track to the Capitaine Bougainville monument which commemorates a naval tragedy happened off shore in 1975. The track itself was described on the info board and the trail notes, not to mention Topo maps. But there was a “private property” sign on that track. I wasn’t sure if I could go see the monument but two mountain bikers showed up, as well as a local hiker, who all said they’ve been to it before and they just ignored the sign. So I did. The view over the coast is amazing.

Poor Knights Islands is a bunch of islands about 40 km offshore. I’ve heard lots about it recently (hanging around people mad about fishing and diving). I want to go dive there next time.

Then I came to Sandy Bay. The beach is beautiful; no wonder it was so busy. In previous years the trail would go on to Matapouri and walk a bush track featuring Tane Moana - a giant kauri tree. But this year there is a large land closure (might be because of slips) so we have to go do a road detour (with a small bit of an old tramway) to Ngunguru.

It was not in the trail notes (at least the ones I lasted updated). But it was there in the trail status webpage which I can only check when I have internet. It’s good that they’ve added a sign here otherwise many would probably try to go the old way.

Even though it’s not on this years’ trail, I hiked to Matapouri anyway to visit the store. It was very popular. I had hot chips and an ice cream. Oh right now as im typing this I just remembered I bought a bottle of beer I was supposed to drink during dinner. But I forgot! Shock horror! I’ll have to have it at breakfast then. It’s allowed in Northland.

I met a family at the picnic table (while having our hot chips) who had a super cute kid who “loves to flirt” (interjected by the mum). That’s how we started chatting actually. Thanks kid! Mum is Maori and dad is Dutch. They were living in Europe before and had returned to New Zealand a few years ago to get their kids to experience the kiwi lifestyle. They love it here.

I hitched back to Sandy Bay where I will find my lodging for the night - a family bach of a mate (thanks Freya!). It’s a bach right beside the beach (!!). My instructions were to go by the beach since it was easier to reach from than the road. There were 5 families here over labour weekend. And I met Will and Janine who are really nice. They showed me how everything worked and what to do when I leave tomorrow. It’s quite a list. I’ve written them down but I hope I got them right. Oh and they also have a magnificent dog Sashi!

Tomorrow I will tackle the road detour.

Ngunguru here I come.
