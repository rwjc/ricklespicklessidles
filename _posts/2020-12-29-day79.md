Starveall hut to Mt Rintoul Hut

19.2km ~ 10:05

A brisk morning. Tony made bacon and made everyone jealous.

We set off just before 7. Today was going to be a long day.

Between the peaks we dropped down into the bush line. It was misty and the sun was shining through. I liked it.

We arrived at Slaty Hut and had a break. We decided on the MEGA option and push onto Mt Rintoul Hut which means we will tackle Little Rintoul and the non-little version as well.

There were lots of tahrs around. They didn’t seem too concerned we were there.

![IMG_1590](/assets/images/20201229/img_1590.jpg)

There’s a mountain called Old Man (1514). We were on it.

There was a simple rain water tank at the top in case you wanted more water. We took some. 

![IMG_1611](/assets/images/20201229/img_1611.jpg)

Onwards and forwards we went. Bottoms up.

We skipped Old Man hut (which would require a detour) and began on the two Rintoul peaks. It’s very rocky and there are lots of scree slopes to negotiate.

More tahrs.

The clouds had started to roll in in the afternoon so we didn’t get many good views after that. This is on top of Little Rintoul (you’ll just have to trust me). 

![IMG_1642](/assets/images/20201229/img_1642.jpg)

After Little we went down steeply on a rocky patch just to go up again on a steep scree to Big Rintoul (hidden by clouds). 

![IMG_1648](/assets/images/20201229/img_1648.jpg)

Down we go. This actually was just after a somewhat gnarly bit. You’ll know it when you get there. It’s not bad though. Just a bit of care will see you through. 

![IMG_1654](/assets/images/20201229/img_1654.jpg)

Sometimes the scree turns into bigger rocks. 

![IMG_1660](/assets/images/20201229/img_1660.jpg)

When we got to Big Rintoul there was actually a bit of view. Not great not terrible. We couldn’t see Little Rintoul though looking back which was a bummer. 

![IMG_1663](/assets/images/20201229/img_1663.jpg)

This is Mt Rintoul summit (you’ll just have to trust me again on this; but it’s fine if you don’t).

![IMG_1667](/assets/images/20201229/img_1667.jpg)

Alpine cauliflower. 

![IMG_1670](/assets/images/20201229/img_1670.jpg)

The Eye of Sauron sees all. 

![IMG_1672](/assets/images/20201229/img_1672.jpg)

After coming down from the summit for a bit the cloud up top actually magically disappeared for a wee while. 

![IMG_1677](/assets/images/20201229/img_1677.jpg)

![IMG_1678](/assets/images/20201229/img_1678.jpg)

But for us it’s time to descend into the clouds on another steep scree slope. Yay. 

![IMG_1679](/assets/images/20201229/img_1679.jpg)

It wasn’t long until we got to Mt Rintoul hut which was (no surprise) full again. Lots of interesting characters including a 2016 TA alumni and another section hiker. My mind wasn’t in the right place so I missed all the names. 

We camped. 

![IMG_1690](/assets/images/20201229/img_1690.jpg)

On the front door:

![IMG_1689](/assets/images/20201229/img_1689.jpg)

Having a yarn at the fireplace. 

![IMG_1691](/assets/images/20201229/img_1691.jpg)

A bunch of them came to check out my tent for some reason. So I gave them the grand tour. 

Night night.
