  I have been entertained by your posts, thankyou.  In fact you have had me
  reading them all day totally addicted.  I'm planning a similar timeframe 2021
  and your notes have provided me a structure to get started.  I'll do the NI
  first and be home for Christmas.  Well written, fun and authentic Rick!  All
  the best in the last leg.
