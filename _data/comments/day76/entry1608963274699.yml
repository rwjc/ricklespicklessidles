message: "Well done on the finish of the North Island Rick! The start of SI looks great.\r\nBarbs arm has finally healed after the 90mile beach episode. We catch your posts now and then just to remind us where we may have been. Next season looks like a restart. Good luck on your SI part Rick.\r\nPaul & Barb."
