message: "Thanks Sandra! I couldn’t help the type of things I attract \U0001F605\r\n\r\nThe sketchy parts are the river crossings. But if the water level is low and slow it’s alright doing it solo. Otherwise it’s worth having others there (helps with the navigation as well since some tracks are badly marked)."
