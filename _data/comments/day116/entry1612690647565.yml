message: "I normally don’t stray too far from my pack. I’ve found it’s pretty safe generally. Often I’d leave my pack outside of a cafe when I go inside and eat; or I just eat outside with my pack. Everyone does this and it’s not a problem. \r\n\r\nAge isn’t an issue. Don’t let it influence what you want to do I say. I’ve met people of all ages on trail. I would recommend doing some solo overnight hikes first to try out all your gear. Also find some trails with hills so you could get a feel of the pack as you walk. Oh and put special emphasis and care on your socks and shoes. They can make or break a hike."
