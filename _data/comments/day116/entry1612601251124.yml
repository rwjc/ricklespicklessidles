  Still following, not weird though. Wonderful country your photos show that.
  I'm planning my own TA leaving late Sept early Oct 2021 and tracking your
  progress.  I see you prefer to use your tent in the SI.  What other gear would
  you take or drop?  So many other questions.  Enjoy your posts.
