message: "Hi Sandra! Not weird at all. \r\n\r\nI started Oct 12. It’s considered slightly early but definitely doable. There are many who start even earlier, eg in September. That may mean you need to prepare for potentially more colder nights. The first night I felt really cold was the campsite on Makene Road just after Ratea forest. There were only a few nights so far that I felt really cold. Generally it’s been warm. \r\n\r\nI have been in huts most of the time in the South Island. I camped in Fern Burn hut because there was a drunk weird guy who beltches and farts in the hut. The ground outside was pretty good for tenting. Also I missed camping almost everyday on the NI. I’m looking to camp more if the conditions are good. \r\n\r\nI might drop my umbrella. It’s been useful more in the north island. But I may just keep it since I’m known for it now. \r\n\r\nI may take a better rain jacket. But I’ve actually used it very little so it may not be worth it. \r\n\r\nI had a pair of pants before. I’m going to send it home. I don’t really need it. (I should’ve realised it a long time ago). \r\n\r\nI’ve acquired a grocery bag (the soft kind). It’s very convenient. Other things I’ve found convenient are: my adidas gym sack (for walking around town and for cycling), clothes to wear when you do laundry. \r\n\r\nSomething I still need to get is a proper waterproof bag/case for my phone. \r\n\r\nHope that helps!"
