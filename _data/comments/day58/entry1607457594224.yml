  Rick; I'm binge reading your posts here on cold rainy Vancouver Island (BC,
  Canada) instead of working.  Pretty much locked down with COVID restrictions.
  I had planned on the TA (NOBO South Island) this year but sadly, it ain't
  happening, so I am living it through blogs instead. I see we share good taste
  in tents and packs (I acquired same as you for the TA).  I hope to be caught
  up on reading the posts soon but am not rushing the experience (trying to be
  as zen-like as possible :-) in the spirit of the TA).  Thanks for the fun
  posts.  Jeff
