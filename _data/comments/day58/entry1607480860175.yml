message: "Hiya Jeff! Thanks for following \U0001F604\r\n\r\nTo be honest for the past week or so it’s been pretty cold and rainy here too (with the odd day of sunshine).\r\n\r\nThe TA will always be here so take care of yourself and your family and I’m sure you’ll be down this part of the world in no time! By then I will hopefully be able to come and visit North America (especially Canada) again!\r\n\r\nYeah the Mariposa and my X-Mid have been really good to me. They are great gear!"
