message: "Hey Rick, \r\n\r\nWell I started to follow you back at the Cape and to be honest I didn't think I would go the journey, however as you became more natural in you posts the more I enjoyed them and I look forward to the remainder.\r\nCongratulations on an outstanding achievement and certainly an inspiration to those who hope to follow in your foot steps.\r\n\r\nThanks again"
