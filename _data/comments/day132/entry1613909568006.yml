I'm so proud of you for finishing!! \U0001F606 Your awesome bunch of friends must've helped keep you on the straight and narrow all the way to Bluff \U0001F61D\r\n\r\nI also love that at the end of this massive journey you still feel like walking some more.\r\n\r\nI hope you continue to document your walks - I'm certainly getting great entertainment out of reading about your exploits.\r\n\r\nIt'll probably feel bittersweet for you but I'm looking forward to celebrating with you on home turf eventually haha \r\n\r\n\U0001F389\U0001F396\U0001FA85"
